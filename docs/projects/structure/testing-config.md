# Testing Configuration & Modernization Guide

**Functionality:** `testing-config`

**Last Updated:** June 26, 2025

This document outlines the testing architecture, configurations, and critical best practices for this project. It incorporates recent advancements in Jest, React, and Next.js to ensure a robust, maintainable, and type-safe testing strategy.

## üö® CRITICAL: ANTI-POLYFILL MANDATE (2025)

**This codebase FORBIDS polyfills.** Next.js 15 + Node 22 LTS provides all necessary APIs natively.

### ‚ùå BANNED PACKAGES & PATTERNS

- `core-js`, `@babel/polyfill`, `react-app-polyfill`, `polyfill.io`
- `whatwg-fetch`, `isomorphic-fetch`, `cross-fetch`
- Any package that patches `globalThis`, `window`, or `global`
- Any "kitchen-sink" polyfills for legacy browser support

### ‚úÖ MODERN ALTERNATIVES ONLY

- **Native APIs**: Use Node 22's built-in `fetch`, `URL`, `TextEncoder`, `ReadableStream`
- **Ponyfills**: Import-only modules that don't mutate globals
- **Feature Detection**: Dynamic imports with runtime capability checks
- **Server-First**: Move processing to Server Components/Edge Functions
- **Current Documentation**: Always verify patterns via Context7/DeepWiki MCPs

## 1. üö® Core Principle: We Use Jest, Not Bun's Native Runner

This project exclusively uses **Jest** as its test runner, executed via `bun run` scripts. This is a non-negotiable standard.

### 1.1. Why We Use Jest

- **Comprehensive Ecosystem:** Robust support for React Testing Library, JSDOM, and advanced mocking.
- **Stability:** Mature and battle-tested for large-scale applications.
- **`next/jest` Integration:** Official Next.js plugin that automatically handles SWC transformation, module mocking, and path aliasing.

### 1.2. The Dangers of `bun test`

Using `bun test` directly **is a critical violation** that bypasses our entire Jest configuration (`config/jest/config.ts`). This leads to immediate and catastrophic test failures, including:

- `jest.mock is not defined`
- Module resolution failures (path aliases, etc.)
- Missing JSDOM environment (`document is not defined`)
- Failure to load mocks and test environment setup

### 1.3. ‚úÖ Mandatory Test Execution Commands

**ALWAYS** use these `bun run` scripts. They are the only valid way to run tests.

```bash
# ‚úÖ Run all tests with proper Jest configuration
bun run test

# ‚úÖ Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# ‚úÖ Generate a coverage report
bun run test:coverage

# ‚úÖ Run tests in a CI environment
bun run test:ci

# ‚úÖ Run a specific test file or directory
bun run test -- __tests__/components/ui/code-block.test.tsx
```

### 1.4. The Vitest Alternative

While Jest is our standard, we acknowledge that the modern JavaScript ecosystem evolves rapidly. If intractable issues arise with Jest, particularly with ESM compatibility or complex `next/jest` behavior, **Vitest** is our designated alternative. A migration to Vitest would be a significant undertaking and should only be considered if:

1. A Jest-related problem blocks critical development.
2. A comprehensive migration plan is approved.
3. The issue has been thoroughly investigated and documented.

For now, all efforts must focus on maintaining a healthy test suite with Jest.

## 2. Modern Testing Context: Jest, React, & Next.js Updates

The following sections summarize key changes and their implications for our testing practices.

### 2.1. Jest Updates (v28-v30)

- **Native ESM Support:** Jest's support for ES Modules is much improved but can still be complex with TypeScript and `next/jest`. Our configuration handles this, but be mindful of `import` vs. `require` issues in mock files.
- **`jest.mocked()` Helper:** The `jest.mocked()` helper is now the standard for typing mocked functions and modules. The old second argument (`true`) is deprecated.
  ```typescript
  import { myFunction } from '../my-function';
  jest.mock('../my-function');

  // New standard: provides deep mock types
  const mockedMyFunction = jest.mocked(myFunction);
  mockedMyFunction.mockReturnValue('new value');

  // For shallow mocks (rarely needed)
  const shallowMock = jest.mocked(myFunction, { shallow: true });
  ```
- **Snapshot Format Changes:** Snapshots generated by newer Jest versions may have minor formatting differences. If a snapshot fails after an upgrade, it's often safe to update it with `u` after verifying the changes are benign.
- **Stricter Types:** Jest's internal types are now stricter. This is a benefit, as it helps enforce our own type safety rules.

### 2.2. React 18 & 19 Testing Context

- **Automatic Batching:** State updates inside tests are now automatically batched. This can simplify tests, but requires using `act` or `waitFor` to ensure the component has fully updated before making assertions.
- **React 19 `use` Hook:** The new `use` hook simplifies handling promises in components. When testing components that use it, you'll need to mock the promise-based functions it consumes.
  ```typescript
  // Example: Testing a component with use(fetchData())
  import { fetchData } from '../data';
  jest.mock('../data');

  it('renders data correctly', async () => {
    jest.mocked(fetchData).mockResolvedValue('Mocked Data');
    const { findByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(await findByText('Mocked Data')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```
- **Actions & `useActionState`:** Testing components with Actions requires dispatching form actions or invoking the action function directly within your test, then using `waitFor` to assert the resulting state changes.
- **Server Components:** Jest tests run in a Node.js environment, so they can't render Server Components directly in a browser-like tree. We test them by:
    1. **Treating them as pure functions:** For Server Components that primarily fetch data and pass it to Client Components, we test the data-fetching logic separately and then test the child Client Components with mocked props.
    2. **Using `next/jest`:** The `next/jest` plugin provides the necessary transforms to handle Server Component syntax in a test environment.

### 2.3. Next.js 14 & 15 Testing Context

- **App Router & `next/navigation`:** When testing components that use hooks like `useRouter`, `usePathname`, or `useSearchParams`, you **must** mock the `next/navigation` module.
  ```typescript
  // in __tests__/__mocks__/next/navigation.js
  module.exports = {
    ...jest.requireActual('next/navigation'),
    useRouter: () => ({ push: jest.fn() }),
    usePathname: () => '/',
    useSearchParams: () => new URLSearchParams(),
  };
  ```
- **Server Actions:** Test Server Actions as if they were regular async functions. You can import them directly into your test file, call them with test data, and assert their return value.
- **Caching (`unstable_cache`, `React.cache`):** Next.js and React caching functions can interfere with tests by returning stale data.
  - **Best Practice:** Structure your code to allow injection of cached functions as dependencies, so you can provide un-cached versions in tests.
  - **Alternative:** Use `jest.requireActual` to bypass mocks for specific tests where you need to test the caching behavior itself.

## 3. Testing Strategy & Best Practices

### 3.1. Multi-Layered Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Isolate and test individual functions, utilities, and hooks.
- **Component Tests**: Use React Testing Library to verify component rendering and behavior.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between different modules (e.g., a form component and a data-fetching service).
- **E2E Smoke Tests**: High-level tests to simulate basic user flows and validate key pages render without errors.

### 3.2. Best Practices

1. **ALWAYS** use `bun run test` scripts, never `bun test` directly.
2. Keep tests focused on a single concern.
3. Assign tests to their specific functionality; avoid generic "testing" names.
4. Ensure all test data is fully and strictly typed.
5. Keep test configurations minimal and document custom matchers and utilities.
6. Validate file naming conventions and type safety in the CI pipeline.

## 4. Configuration & Architecture

The testing setup is highly configured to enforce our standards. All test-related files are located in the `__tests__` directory.

### 4.1. Key Configuration Files

- **`config/jest/config.ts`**: The single source of truth for Jest configuration.
- **`config/jest/setup.ts`**: Global setup file. Imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` and other initializers.
- **`config/jest/polyfills.js`**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGACY FILE**: Contains browser API shims for older Node versions. **Will be removed** as Node 22 provides these natively.
- **`__tests__/tsconfig.json`**: A separate TypeScript configuration for the test environment.

### 4.2. Mocking System

- **`__tests__/__mocks__`**: Contains manual mocks for critical modules like `next/navigation`, `next/font`, and static assets (`file-mock.js`, `style-mock.js`).

### 4.3. VSCode Integration

With the [Jest extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest), you can run and debug tests directly from your editor. The extension should automatically detect and use our Jest configuration.

## 5. Security & Performance Issues

This section is retained from previous documentation for awareness.

### üü° MEDIUM Priority Issues

1. **Shell Injection Risk** (`scripts/setup-test-alias.sh`): Uses unescaped shell expansion. **Fix**: Use proper quoting or safer methods if this script is ever modified.
2. **Synchronous File Operations** (`scripts/check-file-naming.ts`): Uses sync file system calls. **Fix**: Refactor to use async `fs.promises` if performance becomes an issue.

## 6. Documentation & Further Learning

Staying current is critical. Use these resources to find the latest information.

- **Official Next.js Testing Docs:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/testing/jest](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/testing/jest)
- **Official Jest Docs:** [https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react)

You are encouraged to use **Context7 MCP** for deep, version-specific documentation searches.

- **Example Workflow:** First, find the exact library version from `package.json`. Then, construct the query dynamically: `@mcp_context7 get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID='/[org]/[project]/[retrieved-version]' --topic='[topic]'`

## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem:** `ReferenceError: jest is not defined`
**Cause:** You ran `bun test` directly.
**Solution:** **ALWAYS** use `bun run test`.

**Problem:** `Cannot find module '@/components/...'`
**Cause:** Path alias resolution failed because you ran `bun test` directly.
**Solution:** **ALWAYS** use `bun run test`.

**Problem:** `ReferenceError: document is not defined`
**Cause:** The JSDOM environment wasn't loaded because you ran `bun test` directly.
**Solution:** **ALWAYS** use `bun run test`.

**Problem:** A Server Component test fails with unexpected rendering.
**Cause:** You are trying to render it like a Client Component.
**Solution:** Test its data-fetching logic as a function and test its child Client Components separately with mock props.

## 8. Advanced Topics & Modern Patterns

This section provides deeper insight into complex topics that are critical for maintaining a robust test suite in a modern Next.js environment.

### 8.1. Navigating a 100% ESM Codebase with Jest

While we write our code using ES Modules (`import`/`export`), it's crucial to understand what happens under the hood. Jest traditionally worked in a CommonJS (`require`) environment. **`next/jest` bridges this gap by using the SWC compiler to transpile our ESM code into a format Jest can understand.**

This has several implications:

- **Write Modern Code:** You should always use ESM syntax in your application and test files. `next/jest` will handle the transformation.
- **Mocking Nuances:** When mocking modules, especially those that might be CommonJS under the hood, you may encounter complexities. The standard `jest.mock('./my-module')` works for ESM, but if you're providing a manual factory function, you might need to handle the `__esModule` property to correctly mock default exports.
    ```typescript
    // When mocking a module with a default export
    jest.mock('../my-module', () => ({
      __esModule: true, // Indicates this is an ES module mock
      default: jest.fn(), // Mock the default export
      namedExport: jest.fn(), // Mock a named export
    }));
    ```
- **Jest 30+ ESM Enhancements:** Jest now natively recognizes `.mts` and `.cts` files, and its internal modules are bundled as ESM. This improves performance but means any unsupported "deep imports" into Jest's internals will break. **Rule: Only use Jest's public, documented APIs.**

### 8.2. Using `node_modules` as a Source of Truth

In a ZERO TEMPERATURE environment, external documentation can be outdated. The code in `node_modules` is the ultimate source of truth.

**Mandatory Verification Workflow:**

1. **Check `package.json` for Entry Points:**
    ```bash
    # See how the package exposes its modules
    cat node_modules/some-library/package.json | jq .exports
    ```
    The `exports` field tells you exactly which files are public API.

2. **Read the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`:**
    ```bash
    # For usage and breaking changes
    cat node_modules/some-library/README.md
    cat node_modules/some-library/CHANGELOG.md
    ```

3. **Inspect Type Definitions (`.d.ts`):** For absolute clarity on types, read the declaration files directly. This is non-negotiable for ensuring type safety.
    ```bash
    # Find and read the type declaration files
    find node_modules/some-library -name "*.d.ts" | xargs cat
    ```

### 8.3. Modern Test Environment: Native APIs & Strategic Mocks

**Node 22 LTS Provides Native Browser APIs**: Our test environment now has built-in `fetch`, `URL`, `TextEncoder`, `ReadableStream`, and other Web APIs. **No polyfills needed.**

- **Legacy Polyfills (`config/jest/polyfills.js`):** ‚ö†Ô∏è **SCHEDULED FOR REMOVAL**. Node 22 makes this file obsolete. Any remaining browser API gaps should be handled with targeted mocks, not polyfills.

- **Manual Mocks (`__tests__/__mocks__/`):** This directory is essential for controlling the test environment.
  - **`next/navigation`**: **The most important mock.** Required for any component using App Router hooks like `useRouter`, `usePathname`, etc. We provide a mock implementation that returns default values and mock functions.
  - **`next/font`**: Next.js font optimization functions would error in Jest. This mock returns dummy class names to allow components to render.
  - **`file-mock.js` & `style-mock.js`**: Jest cannot process static assets like images or CSS files. These mocks tell Jest to replace any import of these files with a simple string or an empty object, preventing errors.
  - **`server-only`**: This package throws an error if imported on the client. Our mock makes it a no-op in the test environment, allowing us to test components that use it without crashing.

## 9. Native `fetch` & Advanced Next.js 15 Testing Patterns

This section details how to confidently use the modern, native `fetch` API and test the latest Next.js 15 features, ensuring our test suite remains robust and up-to-date.

### 9.1. Confidently Using Native `fetch` in Node.js 22

As of Node.js v21, the `fetch` API is stable and built-in, powered by the high-performance `undici` client, as noted in the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/fetch) and confirmed by performance benchmarks. For our project on Node 22, this means:

- **ZERO POLYFILLS NEEDED:** Node 22 provides native `fetch`, `URL`, `TextEncoder`, `ReadableStream`, and other Web APIs
- **Legacy Package Removal:** Any `node-fetch`, `whatwg-fetch`, or similar packages should be removed from dependencies
- **Native Code Mandate:** All application and test code MUST use the global, native `fetch` API
- **Next.js 15 Integration:** Next.js 15 uses this native `fetch` and extends it with its own caching and revalidation semantics
- **No Import Required:** Never `import fetch` - it's globally available like in browsers

### 9.2. The Canonical Pattern for Mocking `fetch` in Jest Tests

To achieve 100% confidence and immediate test-passing, we **must** mock the global `fetch` function. This gives us full control over the testing environment, removes network latency, and isolates our code from the Next.js caching layer.

**The Standard Mock Implementation:**

This should be your default approach in any test file that triggers a `fetch` call.

```typescript
// In your test file: my-component.test.ts

// Mock global.fetch before all tests
beforeEach(() => {
  global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({ data: 'mocked response' }),
    })
  ) as jest.Mock;
});

// Clear mocks after each test
afterEach(() => {
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

it('should render data fetched from an API', async () => {
  // You can override the global mock for a specific test case
  jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockImplementationOnce(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({ user: { name: 'William' } }),
    })
  );

  render(<MyComponent />);

  // Assert that the component renders the mocked data
  expect(await screen.findByText('William')).toBeInTheDocument();
  // Verify that fetch was called
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/api/user', expect.anything());
});
```

### 9.3. Testing Next.js 14 & 15 Features

#### Experimental Features (`experiments` in `next.config.js`)

You've correctly identified that we have several experimental features enabled. Here is how to approach testing them:

1. **`useCache`**:
    - **Concept:** This hook wraps a data-fetching function to provide React-level caching (deduplication) for requests within a single render pass.
    - **Testing Strategy:** Do not test `useCache` itself. Test the function that you *pass into* `useCache`. Your test should mock the underlying data-fetching function (`getUser`, `getArticles`, etc.) and verify that your component renders correctly with the mocked data. The caching behavior is an implementation detail of the framework.

2. **`taint` (`experimental_taintObjectReference`)**:
    - **Concept:** A security feature to prevent server-only data or objects from being passed to the client.
    - **Testing Strategy:** This requires a specific integration test. You must create a test case that simulates a Server Component attempting to pass a "tainted" object as a prop to a Client Component. The test should assert that this action **throws an error**, proving the taint mechanism is working as expected.

3. **`webpackBuildWorker`**:
    - **Concept:** A build-time performance optimization.
    - **Testing Strategy:** This feature has **no impact** on our application logic or unit/integration tests. It can be safely ignored during test writing.

#### New Stable & Unstable Features

- **Partial Prerendering (PPR):**
  - **Concept:** Next.js serves a static shell of a page, with dynamic "holes" that are streamed in.
  - **Testing Strategy:** This is primarily an E2E testing concern. For our Jest tests, we test the components in isolation:
        1. Test the static shell component (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`) with mock props.
        2. Test the dynamic components that fill the "holes" (e.g., `<Suspense fallback={...}>`) as individual components.

- **`after()` API:**
  - **Concept:** Allows you to run code *after* a response has finished streaming to the user.
  - **Testing Strategy:** This is for side-effects (e.g., logging, analytics). Your test should mock the route handler, call it, and then assert that the side-effect function (which you should also mock) was called.

- **Server Actions:**
  - **Testing Strategy:** As documented, treat them as standalone asynchronous functions. Import the action into your test, call it with mock data, and `await` the result to make assertions. Ensure you test both success and error states.

### 9.4. Advanced Type-Level Testing with TypeScript 5.8

Beyond testing the runtime behavior of our code, it's critical to test the *types themselves*. This is especially important for generic utilities, hooks, and complex type definitions to ensure they behave as expected for developers consuming them. As [Matt Pocock highlights](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-test-your-types), this is a key practice for any high-quality library or shared codebase.

These "type tests" are not executed by Jest. Instead, they are validated by the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) during our `bun run validate` step. A failed type test will result in a standard TypeScript error, failing the build.

#### The Canonical Pattern: `Expect` and `Equal`

We will adopt a lightweight, powerful pattern for asserting type equality. Add the following utility types to a central testing types file (e.g., `types/testing.d.ts`):

```typescript
// types/testing.d.ts

/**
 * Asserts that a type is 'true'. Used with 'Equal'.
 * @example type test = Expect<Equal<string, string>> // passes
 */
export type Expect<T extends true> = T;

/**
 * Checks if two types are exactly the same.
 * @example type test = Equal<string, string> // true
 * @example type test = Equal<string, number> // false
 */
export type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <
  T
>() => T extends Y ? 1 : 2
  ? true
  : false;
```

**Usage in a Test File:**

You can use these helpers within any `.test.ts` file to create compile-time assertions.

```typescript
import type { Expect, Equal } from '@/types/testing';

const someGenericFunc = <T>(arg: T): { value: T } => ({ value: arg });

it('should correctly infer the return type', () => {
  const result = someGenericFunc('hello');

  // This line is a compile-time test.
  // If typeof result is not exactly { value: 'hello' }, `tsc` will error.
  type test = Expect<Equal<typeof result, { value: 'hello' }>>;

  // This is the runtime test.
  expect(result.value).toBe('hello');
});
```

#### Asserting Expected Errors with `@ts-expect-error`

To verify that our types correctly prevent invalid usage, we use the `@ts-expect-error` comment. This special comment tells TypeScript to expect an error on the very next line. The build will fail if there *isn't* an error, proving that our types are correctly restrictive.

```typescript
const requiresString = <T extends string>(arg: T) => {};

it('should not accept a number', () => {
  // This test passes if `tsc` reports an error on the next line.
  // It fails if myFunc(123) is somehow valid.
  // @ts-expect-error
  requiresString(123);
});

it('should accept a string', () => {
  // No error is expected here.
  requiresString('hello');
});
```

#### TypeScript 5.8 Considerations: Import Attributes

While not a testing feature, a key change in TypeScript 5.8 that can affect tests is the stabilization of **Import Attributes**. The old `assert { type: 'json' }` syntax for importing JSON is now deprecated in favor of `with { type: 'json' }`.

```typescript
// Old way (will error in TS 5.8 with modern module settings)
// import data from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' };

// New, correct way
import data from './data.json' with { type: 'json' };
```

Our `bun run validate` command will fail if the old syntax is used, so all developers and tools must use the `with` keyword for such imports to ensure our tests and codebase remain compliant.

## 10. Async Testing Patterns: Critical Do's and Don'ts

This section addresses the most common async testing mistakes that lead to flaky, unreliable tests. These patterns are based on [proven testing library best practices](https://dev.to/tipsy_dev/testing-library-writing-better-async-tests-c67) and Next.js-specific async behaviors.

### 10.1. üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION: Awaiting Synchronous Methods

**‚ùå WRONG - Awaiting `render()`:**
```typescript
// This creates false positives and timing-dependent failures
it('should display user data', async () => {
  await render(<UserProfile userId="123" />); // ‚ùå render() is synchronous!
  expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument(); // May fail due to timing
});
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Using Async Queries:**
```typescript
it('should display user data', async () => {
  render(<UserProfile userId="123" />); // ‚úÖ No await on render
  expect(await screen.findByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument(); // ‚úÖ Await the async query
});
```

**Why This Matters:**

- `render()` is synchronous but returns a value that JavaScript converts to a resolved Promise when awaited
- This creates a race condition where your assertion might run before async operations complete
- In Next.js 15, Server Components and `use()` hooks make this timing even more critical

### 10.2. üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION: Missing `await` on Async Methods

**‚ùå WRONG - Missing `await` on `waitFor`:**
```typescript
// This test will always pass, even when it should fail
it('should handle loading state', async () => {
  render(<AsyncComponent />);
  
  // ‚ùå Missing await - test completes before assertion runs
  waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading complete')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  // Test exits here, assertion never validates
});
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Proper `await` Usage:**
```typescript
it('should handle loading state', async () => {
  render(<AsyncComponent />);
  
  // ‚úÖ Properly awaited - test waits for assertion
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading complete')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 10.3. üö® CRITICAL VIOLATION: Side Effects in `waitFor`

**‚ùå WRONG - Triggering Events Inside `waitFor`:**
```typescript
// This creates infinite loops and unpredictable behavior
it('should show transaction details', async () => {
  render(<TransactionList />);
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Transaction #1')); // ‚ùå Side effect in waitFor
    expect(screen.getByText('Details: Coffee purchase')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Side Effects Outside `waitFor`:**
```typescript
it('should show transaction details', async () => {
  render(<TransactionList />);
  
  // ‚úÖ Wait for element to appear, then interact
  const transaction = await screen.findByText('Transaction #1');
  fireEvent.click(transaction);
  
  // ‚úÖ Then wait for the result
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Details: Coffee purchase')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 10.4. Next.js-Specific Async Patterns

#### Server Actions Testing

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Testing Server Actions as Functions:**
```typescript
import { updateUserProfile } from '@/app/actions';

// Mock any dependencies
jest.mock('@/lib/database', () => ({
  updateUser: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '123', name: 'Updated Name' })
}));

it('should update user profile', async () => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('name', 'New Name');
  formData.append('userId', '123');
  
  // ‚úÖ Test the Server Action directly
  const result = await updateUserProfile(formData);
  
  expect(result).toEqual({ id: '123', name: 'Updated Name' });
});
```

#### Components Using Server Actions

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Testing Form Components with Actions:**
```typescript
import { updateUserProfile } from '@/app/actions';
jest.mock('@/app/actions');

it('should submit form and show success', async () => {
  jest.mocked(updateUserProfile).mockResolvedValue({ success: true });
  
  render(<UserProfileForm />);
  
  // Fill form
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Name'), 'New Name');
  
  // Submit form
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }));
  
  // Wait for success message
  expect(await screen.findByText('Profile updated successfully')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### Testing `use()` Hook Components (React 19)

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Mocking Promise-Based Data:**
```typescript
import { fetchUserData } from '@/lib/api';
jest.mock('@/lib/api');

it('should render user data with use() hook', async () => {
  // ‚úÖ Mock the promise that use() will consume
  jest.mocked(fetchUserData).mockResolvedValue({
    name: 'William',
    email: 'william@example.com'
  });
  
  render(<UserProfileWithUse userId="123" />);
  
  // ‚úÖ Wait for the promise to resolve and component to render
  expect(await screen.findByText('William')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('william@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 10.5. Native `fetch` Testing Patterns for Node.js 22

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Comprehensive `fetch` Mocking (No Polyfills):**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ MODERN: Global setup for native fetch mocking (Node 22 LTS)
beforeEach(() => {
  global.fetch = jest.fn();
});

afterEach(() => {
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

it('should handle successful API response', async () => {
  // ‚úÖ Mock successful response using native fetch types
  jest.mocked(global.fetch).mockResolvedValueOnce({
    ok: true,
    status: 200,
    json: async () => ({ data: 'success' }),
    headers: new Headers(),
    statusText: 'OK',
  } as Response);
  
  render(<DataComponent />);
  
  expect(await screen.findByText('success')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/api/data', expect.any(Object));
});

it('should handle API errors gracefully', async () => {
  // ‚úÖ Mock error response using native Response constructor
  jest.mocked(global.fetch).mockResolvedValueOnce({
    ok: false,
    status: 500,
    json: async () => ({ error: 'Server error' }),
    headers: new Headers(),
    statusText: 'Internal Server Error',
  } as Response);
  
  render(<DataComponent />);
  
  expect(await screen.findByText('Error loading data')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS: Import fetch polyfills
// import fetch from 'node-fetch'; // BANNED
// import 'whatwg-fetch'; // BANNED
```

### 10.6. TypeScript 5 Async Type Safety

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Type-Safe Async Testing:**
```typescript
// Define expected response types
interface UserResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

it('should maintain type safety in async operations', async () => {
  const mockResponse: UserResponse = {
    id: '123',
    name: 'William',
    email: 'william@example.com'
  };
  
  // ‚úÖ TypeScript ensures mock matches expected interface
  jest.mocked(global.fetch).mockResolvedValueOnce({
    ok: true,
    json: async (): Promise<UserResponse> => mockResponse,
  } as Response);
  
  render(<TypedUserComponent />);
  
  expect(await screen.findByText('William')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 10.7. ESLint Rules for Async Testing

These ESLint rules from `eslint-plugin-testing-library` prevent the above mistakes:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "testing-library/await-async-utils": "error",
    "testing-library/await-async-query": "error", 
    "testing-library/no-wait-for-side-effects": "error",
    "testing-library/no-unnecessary-act": "error"
  }
}
```

### 10.8. Quick Reference: Async Testing Checklist

**‚úÖ DO:**

- Use `await` with `findBy*`, `waitFor`, `waitForElementToBeRemoved`
- Trigger side effects (clicks, inputs) outside of `waitFor`
- Mock `global.fetch` using native Node 22 LTS APIs (no imports needed)
- Test Server Actions as standalone async functions
- Use proper TypeScript types for all mock responses
- Verify current patterns via Context7/DeepWiki MCPs before implementing

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- `await render()` or other synchronous functions
- Put `fireEvent` or `user` interactions inside `waitFor`
- Forget `await` on async testing utilities
- Mix synchronous assertions with async operations
- Test without mocking external dependencies
- **Import any fetch polyfills** (`node-fetch`, `whatwg-fetch`, etc.)
- **Add polyfills for modern Node 22 APIs** (they're native)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

If you find ANY of these imports in test files, remove them immediately:
```typescript
// ‚ùå DELETE THESE LINES
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import 'whatwg-fetch';
import 'isomorphic-fetch';
// ‚úÖ Use global.fetch instead (native in Node 22)
```

This guidance ensures reliable, maintainable tests that accurately reflect user behavior while leveraging modern runtime capabilities.
