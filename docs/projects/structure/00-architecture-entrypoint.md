# Project Architecture Entrypoint

This document serves as the master index for all architectural documentation in the repository. It provides a high-level overview of each defined "functionality," its core objective, and direct links to its detailed documentation and visual diagrams.

**Start here** to understand the structure and responsibilities of different parts of the application.

## üö® CRITICAL: TypeScript, Next.js & React Guidance

This project enforces **100% strict TypeScript type safety** and adherence to modern Next.js and React best practices. All code must pass `bun run validate` before any commit. This is non-negotiable.

For a comprehensive guide on how to diagnose and fix type errors, and for crucial framework guidance, see the master playbook:

**[‚û°Ô∏è Architecting for 100% Type Safety: A Guide for Developers & LLMs](./linting-formatting.md)**

This guide is the **single source of truth** for code quality and covers:

- Foundational TypeScript & ESLint rules.
- Runtime validation with Zod.
- **The Next.js & React Frontend Playbook**: Top 10 common infrastructure issues and their solutions.
- **Tool-Assisted Debugging**: How to use MCP tools like Context7 and web search to resolve issues.
- A visual map of the entire validation and development pipeline.
