 *
 * @description
 * Tests the integration with S3 storage for logo retrieval functionality, specifically
 * the `getLogo` function. Validates S3 operations (read, write, delete) and
 * caching behavior in both integration and unit test environments.
 * Mocks `ServerCacheInstance` and `s3-utils` for controlled unit testing.
 *
 * NOTE: This test is currently skipped due to Web API dependencies (ReadableStream, MessagePort, Request)
 * that are required by the cheerio library used in the data-access module.
 * TODO: Refactor to remove cheerio dependency or run in a Node environment with proper polyfills
