/**
 * React Setup
 *
 * CRITICAL: This file must be loaded LAST in the setup sequence
 * because it requires the window.document object to be fully set up.
 *
 * Order of operations:
 * 1. environment.ts - Sets up Node environment and env variables
 * 2. window.ts - Creates window mock with document object
 * 3. jest.setup.js - Sets up polyfills
 * 4. testing-library.ts - Sets up Testing Library and jest-dom
 * 5. jest.setup.ts - Sets up test utilities and mocks
 * 6. react.ts (this file) - Sets up React

// This file is intentionally empty as it exists to ensure
// React setup happens last in the sequence after all other
// setup files have run
