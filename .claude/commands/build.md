Run the build command and analyze any errors or warnings.

First, execute: bun run build

STEP 1: Output the full build log for reference.

STEP 2: Analyze the build output using @mcp__zen__thinkdeep with model="pro". Use web search and available MCP servers to check current API documentation.

STEP 3: If there are errors:
a) Explain root cause
b) Use Read tool to examine problematic files
c) Use Edit/MultiEdit tools to implement fixes directly
d) Document what was changed

STEP 4: If build succeeds but has warnings, fix those too.

STEP 5: Run "bun run build" again to verify fixes work.

Output final status and all changes made.
