4) Performance issues

Use web search and available MCP servers to verify API usage against current documentation.

STEP 3: For each issue found, use the Edit or MultiEdit tools to implement the fix directly in the codebase.

STEP 4: After all fixes are applied, run git diff again to show the changes made.
