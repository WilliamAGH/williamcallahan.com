Run all tests and fix any failures, then improve coverage.

First, execute: bun run test

STEP 1: Output the full test results.

STEP 2: Perform deep analysis using @mcp__zen__thinkdeep with model="pro" and thinking_mode="high".

STEP 3: For test failures:
a) Use @mcp__zen__debug to identify root causes
b) Use Read tool to examine failing tests and implementation
c) Use Edit/MultiEdit to fix failing tests or implementation bugs
d) Document each fix

STEP 4: For passing tests with low coverage, write new tests using Edit tool.

STEP 5: Run "bun run test" again to verify all tests pass.

Output final test results and all changes made.
