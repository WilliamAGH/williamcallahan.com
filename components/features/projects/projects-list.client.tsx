/**
 * @file Projects List Server Component (was client)
 * @module components/features/projects/projects-list.client
 *
 * @description
 * Server component that renders the full list of projects.  By executing on the
 * server, the <Image> markup for each project card is included in the initial
 * HTML so the browser can start downloading screenshots immediately (improves
 * LCP).
 *
 * Tag-based filtering remains a client concern (handled by ProjectTagsClient).
 * We still render every card here; the client layer simply hides those that are
 * not currently selected.  This avoids search-param coupling while giving us
 * server-rendered images.
