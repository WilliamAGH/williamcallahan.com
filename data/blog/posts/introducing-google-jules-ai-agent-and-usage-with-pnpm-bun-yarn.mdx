<BackgroundInfo title="About Jules AI Agent">
Jules is Google's autonomous coding agent, announced in public beta at [Google I/O 2025](https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/). It runs tasks asynchronously in a secure Google Cloud virtual machine, understands your codebase context, and performs complex coding tasks from natural language prompts.

# Google's Jules: The Autonomous Coding Agent That Works While You Don't

Google has officially released [Jules](https://jules.google) in public beta, making their autonomous coding agent available worldwide. Unlike code completion tools or co-pilots, Jules is a fully autonomous agent that reads your code, understands your intent, and works independently on tasks you'd rather not handle yourself.

Jules operates asynchronously in a secure cloud environment, allowing you to focus on other work while it handles tasks like writing tests, fixing bugs, building features, or updating dependencies. When finished, it presents its reasoning and a diff of the changes made.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Jules leverages [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-pro), giving it access to advanced coding reasoning capabilities. Combined with its cloud VM system, it can handle complex, multi-file changes with impressive speed and precision.

<CollapseDropdown summary="What Makes Jules Different">
  <div>
    - **Works on real codebases**: Jules doesn't need a sandbox. It takes the full context of your existing project to reason about changes intelligently.
    - **Parallel execution**: Tasks run inside a cloud VM, enabling concurrent execution and handling multiple requests simultaneously.
    - **Visible workflow**: Jules shows you its plan and reasoning before making changes, maintaining transparency.
    - **GitHub integration**: Works directly with your GitHub repositories without requiring context-switching.
    - **User control**: Modify the presented plan before, during, and after execution to maintain control over your code.
    - **Audio summaries**: Get audio changelogs of recent commits, turning your project history into something you can listen to.
  </div>

Jules represents Google's latest effort to corner the market for AI agents, which are widely regarded as a more practical and profitable form of chatbot. The agent is built on Gemini 2.5 Pro, which has outscored other industry-leading models on key benchmarks like math and code editing.

## Getting Started with Jules

Getting started with Jules is straightforward. You'll need to connect your GitHub repository and configure your environment.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Onboarding Process">
  <div>
    1. Visit [jules.google](https://jules.google) and sign in with your Google account.
    2. In the Jules dashboard, click **Add Codebase** and authorize GitHub to select your repository.
    3. Open the project dropdown in the top bar and choose **Configuration**.
    4. Review the **Initial setup** commands. These ensure Jules has the right environment to work with your code.
    5. Save your configuration before assigning your first task.
  </div>
</CollapseDropdown>

Once connected, you can start assigning tasks to Jules using natural language prompts. For example, you might ask it to:
- "Fix the failing tests in the authentication module"
- "Update all dependencies to their latest versions"
- "Implement a dark mode toggle for the UI"
- "Refactor the user service to use async/await instead of promises"

### Package Manager Configuration

Make sure you setup your specific package manager for this to work properly. While npm is the default, Jules works with alternative package managers like pnpm, Bun, and Yarn with a bit of tweaking. Here's how I did it.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Automatic Package Manager Detection">
  <div>
    Jules can automatically detect your package manager by identifying lock files in your repository:
    - <code>pnpm-lock.yaml</code> for pnpm
    - <code>bun.lockb</code> for Bun
    - <code>yarn.lock</code> for Yarn

    This automatic detection ensures Jules uses the correct commands when installing dependencies or running scripts.
  </div>
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Manual Package Manager Configuration">
  <div>
    If automatic detection doesn't work or you want to explicitly set your package manager:

    1. Open your project in the Jules dashboard
    2. Navigate to the **Configuration** section
    3. In **Initial setup**, select <code>pnpm</code>, <code>bun</code>, or <code>yarn</code> as your package manager
    4. Save your configuration

    This ensures Jules uses the correct commands when working with your codebase.
  </div>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Custom Configuration Scripts">
  <div>
    Here are example configuration scripts I used for Jules to set up Node.js with different package managers. You can add these in the **Configuration** tab of your Jules project:

        echo "--- Setup complete (Node and Bun dependencies) ---"
        ```

    </InstructionToggleTabs>

    These scripts:
    - Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
    - Set up a specific Node.js version (18.20.8)
    - Verify the Node.js version meets requirements
    - Install dependencies using your chosen package manager

    Both scripts are robust with error handling and verbose logging, which helps when debugging any issues in the Jules environment.

You don't need to modify your scripts or workflow to accommodate Jules—it adapts to your existing setup. Just make sure your dependencies are properly specified in your package.json file, and Jules will handle the rest.

## The AI Coding Agent Landscape in 2025

The release of Jules comes amid intense competition in the AI coding agent space. According to [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-jules-aims-to-out-code-codex-in-battle-for-the-ai-developer-stack/), we're witnessing a battle for the AI developer stack, with several major players offering competing solutions.

<TweetEmbed url="https://x.com/leerob/status/1925228425301893481" />

Here's how Jules compares to other major AI coding assistants:

- **OpenAI Codex** ([Introducing Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/)): Recently released as a research preview, Codex offers a polished UI with inline diff views and a mobile app. However, it currently lacks direct network access within requests and two-way GitHub sync that Jules provides.

- **GitHub Copilot Agent**: Building on the popular Copilot, this agent now offers asynchronous code testing and generation. While it integrates well with GitHub (naturally), it doesn't have the same level of VM-based execution environment as Jules.

- **Devin** ([devin.ai](https://devin.ai)): One of the first autonomous coding agents, Devin offers two-way GitHub integration and real-time preview deployments on Vercel. Its IDE-like controls allow engineers to iterate naturally via Slack or its native UI.

- **Manus** ([manus.im](https://manus.im)): Specializes in code reviews and PR workflows, excelling at rapid context switching and fetching relevant code references within active pull requests.

When choosing between these tools, consider your specific workflow needs—such as network access requirements, GitHub integration depth, UI preferences, and CI/CD integration capabilities.

## Trying Jules Today

During the public beta phase, Jules is available for free with some [usage limits](https://jules.google/docs/usage-limits/). According to Google, they expect to introduce pricing after the beta as the platform matures.

<BackgroundInfo title="Privacy and Security">
Jules is private by default and doesn't train on your private code. Your data stays isolated within the execution environment, addressing a common concern with AI coding tools.
</BackgroundInfo>

For comprehensive documentation on Jules, including detailed guides on running tasks, reviewing code diffs, and managing environments, visit the [official Jules documentation](https://jules.google/docs).

Have you tried Jules or other AI coding agents? I'd be interested to hear about your experiences, especially if you've used alternative package managers with these tools.
