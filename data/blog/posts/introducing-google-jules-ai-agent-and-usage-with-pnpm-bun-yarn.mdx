<BackgroundInfo title="About Jules AI Agent">
Jules is an AI coding agent from Google, announced yesterday at [Google I/O](https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/). It integrates with GitHub, runs tasks asynchronously in a virtual machine, applies code changes, runs tests, and opens pull requests with inline diffs and activity logs.

# Google Just Launched Google Jules - An Autonomous Coding AI Agent for Tasks

Jules can fix bugs, bump dependencies, migrate code, and add new features based on natural language prompts. Before assigning tasks, ensure your environment is configured correctly for GitHub access, Node.js, and your package manager. From discusions on

For detailed usage and features, see the <ExternalLink href="https://jules.google/docs">Jules documentation</ExternalLink>.

<BackgroundInfo title="My Early Experience">
I kicked off my first projects with Jules today. As an early user of **Devin** and **Manus**, I noticed similar onboarding prompts and environment checks in Jules.
</BackgroundInfo>

## Onboarding: Add Your GitHub Codebase and Configure Environment

<CollapseDropdown summary="Connect repo and configure environment">
  <div>
    1. In the Jules dashboard, click **Add Codebase** and authorize GitHub to select your repository.<br/>
    2. Open the project dropdown in the top bar and choose **Configuration**.<br/>
    3. Review the **Initial setup** commands. If not using npm, select pnpm, Bun, or Yarn to apply the correct environment commands.<br/>
    4. Save your configuration before assigning your first task.

## Using Alternative Package Managers with Jules

Google Jules operates within a flexible Linux virtual machine, allowing it to adapt to various development environments. This guide focuses on a common use case for JavaScript/TypeScript projects: configuring Jules to work with popular package managers such as `npm`, `pnpm`, `Bun`, or `Yarn`.

If your JavaScript/TypeScript project uses `pnpm`, `Bun`, or `Yarn`, Jules can often detect and utilize your chosen package manager automatically, typically by identifying lock files like `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, or `yarn.lock`.

For these specific package managers, you can also explicitly configure them in the Jules dashboard:
1. Open your project in the Jules dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** section (usually found in the project dropdown).
3. Review the **Initial setup** commands.
4. If Jules hasn't automatically selected your package manager, or if you wish to change it, you can select `pnpm`, `Bun`, or `Yarn` from the available options. Jules will then use the appropriate commands for that package manager when running tasks.
5. Save your configuration.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Installation Instructions for pnpm, Bun, and Yarn">
  <div>
    For instructions on installing `pnpm`, `Bun`, or `Yarn` themselves, please refer to their official documentation:
    - <ExternalLink href="https://pnpm.io/installation">pnpm Installation</ExternalLink>
    - <ExternalLink href="https://bun.sh/docs/installation">Bun Installation</ExternalLink>
    - <ExternalLink href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install">Yarn Installation</ExternalLink>

    Ensure your chosen package manager is installed in the environment where Jules will execute tasks.
  </div>

## Conclusion

You can run Jules tasks with pnpm, Bun, or Yarn without altering scripts—just install dependencies and let Jules execute your setup commands.

## Current Jules Competitors / Alternatives: Comparing AI Coding Assistants

Things are moving fast in this space. Just a few months ago I got access to Dev

<TweetEmbed url="https://x.com/leerob/status/1925228425301893481" />

- **OpenAI Codex** ([Introducing Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/)): Offers a polished UI with inline diff views and a mobile app for on-the-go task review. However, it currently lacks direct network access within requests and two-way GitHub sync.
- **Devin** ([devin.ai](https://devin.ai)): Boasts two-way GitHub integration, real-time preview deployments on Vercel, and deep IDE-like controls, enabling engineers to iterate naturally via Slack or its native UI.
- **DeepWiki** ([deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com)): Provides quick contextual documentation and knowledge retrieval, streamlining onboarding for new codebases by fetching relevant code snippets and explanations.
- **Manus** ([manus.im](https://manus.im)): Excels at rapid context switching and fetching relevant code references within active pull requests, enabling concise code reviews and automated fixes.

Consider your team's workflow needs—such as network access, sync capabilities, UI preferences, and CI/CD integration—when selecting the right assistant for your projects.
