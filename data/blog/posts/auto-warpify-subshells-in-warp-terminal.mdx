Warp Terminal has a useful feature called subshells - isolated terminal environments for different contexts. This post shows how to automate subshells using a custom configuration I call "Warpify".

## What are Warp Subshells?

Warp subshells provide isolated environments where you can run commands without affecting your main terminal session. They work well for ssh'ing to a server, or looking inside a docker container (e.g., docker exec), each with their own environment variables and working directories.

## How to auto Warpify Subshells

Add the snippet to the appropriate RC file in the target environment. For SSH or containers, place it on the host you're
connecting to; for local nested shells, keep it in your local RC file so those inner shells are warpified automatically.

<BackgroundInfo title="Important: Configure this on the host you're connecting to">
  To Warpify SSH or container sessions, add the snippet in the **target environment** — the machine you're connecting to
  (for example: a Docker container, a remote SSH server, or a VM). Place it in that user's shell startup file (`~/.bashrc`
  or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh).

  - **SSH:** edit the remote user's RC file on the server you SSH into.
  - **Docker:** edit the container image or the running container's RC file.
  - **Local nested shells:** add it to your local RC if you want local subshells warpified.
</BackgroundInfo>

### Local nested shells: examples

“Local nested shells” are interactive shells that you launch inside the current Warp session on the same machine (not SSH,
not a container). If you want these inner shells to be warpified without a prompt, add the snippet to your local RC file.

- Switching shells locally
  - From zsh → bash: `bash`, `bash -l`
  - From bash → zsh: `zsh`, `zsh -l`
- Elevating or switching users locally
  - `sudo -s`, `sudo -i`
  - `su - otheruser`, `su -l otheruser`
- Dev tools that spawn subshells
  - `poetry shell`, `pipenv shell`
  - `nix-shell`, `nix develop`
  - `asdf shell <tool> <version>` (depending on setup)
- Multiplexers that launch a fresh shell in new panes or windows
  - `tmux new -s work`, `screen`

What do **not** count as local nested shells (configure the environment you jump into instead):

- `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` → put the snippet in the container user's RC file.
- `ssh user@host` (even `ssh localhost`) → put the snippet on the target machine.

This protection boundary keeps the hook scoped to Warp and to interactive shells only:

```bash
# zsh (~/.zshrc)
if [[ $- == *i* && $TERM_PROGRAM == "WarpTerminal" ]]; then
  printf '\eP$f{"hook":"SourcedRcFileForWarp","value":{"shell":"zsh"}}\x9c'
fi
```

```bash
# bash (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile)
if [[ $- == *i* && $TERM_PROGRAM == "WarpTerminal" ]]; then
  printf '\eP$f{"hook":"SourcedRcFileForWarp","value":{"shell":"bash"}}\x9c'
fi
```

Quick add (local-only, guarded) helpers:

```bash
# zsh (local ~/.zshrc)
cat <<'EOF' >> ~/.zshrc

# Auto-Warpify (Warp) — only in Warp and interactive zsh
if [[ $- == *i* && $TERM_PROGRAM == "WarpTerminal" ]]; then
  printf '\eP$f{"hook":"SourcedRcFileForWarp","value":{"shell":"zsh"}}\x9c'
fi
EOF
```

```bash
# bash (local ~/.bashrc)
cat <<'EOF' >> ~/.bashrc

# Auto-Warpify (Warp) — only in Warp and interactive bash
if [[ $- == *i* && $TERM_PROGRAM == "WarpTerminal" ]]; then
  printf '\eP$f{"hook":"SourcedRcFileForWarp","value":{"shell":"bash"}}\x9c'
fi
EOF
```

For Linux hosts you're connecting to (remote server or container):

```bash
# Warpify subshells in the remote environment (add to remote ~/.bashrc)
printf '\eP$f{"hook": "SourcedRcFileForWarp", "value": { "shell": "bash" }}\x9c'
```
