Warp Terminal is a modern terminal emulator that brings powerful features to command-line workflows. One of its standout features is subshells - isolated terminal environments for different contexts. In this post, we'll explore how to automate the use of subshells using a custom configuration I call "Warpify".

## What are Warp Subshells?

Warp subshells provide isolated environments where you can run commands without affecting your main terminal session. They're perfect for things like ssh'ing to a server, or looking inside a docker container (e.g., docker exec), each with their own environment variables and working directories.

## How to auto Warpify Subshells

Add this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to automatically use Warp subshells when you open a new terminal session.

For modern macOS if you have JetBrains IDE(s) installed (to exclude them):

```bash
# Warpify subshells
if [[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "WarpTerminal" ]]; then
 printf '\eP$f{"hook": "SourcedRcFileForWarp", "value": { "shell": "zsh" }}\x9c'
fi
```

To have the basic config appended to the file automatically, you can just run the following command in your terminal (for macOS):

```bash
echo 'printf '\eP$f{"hook": "SourcedRcFileForWarp", "value": { "shell": "zsh" }}\x9c'' >> ~/.zshrc
```

For Linux:

```bash
# Warpify subshells
printf '\eP$f{"hook": "SourcedRcFileForWarp", "value": { "shell": "bash" }}\x9c'
```

See this article for further documentation on this: [Warpify Subshells](https://warp.dev/docs/subshells).
