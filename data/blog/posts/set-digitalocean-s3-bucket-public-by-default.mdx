<BackgroundInfo title="What This Post Covers">
By the end of this guide you'll know:

- **Why Per-Bucket Access Keys are the secret villain** behind most `403 Forbidden` policy errors.
- **The dead-simple ACL approach** that works every time.
- **When you can safely use a JSON bucket policy** (and when to save yourself the headache).
- **How to turn on server access logging**—no support ticket required anymore.

</BackgroundInfo>

I thought making a bucket public on DigitalOcean Spaces would be a ten-second checkbox. Instead I burned an afternoon chasing `403 Forbidden` errors and second-guessing my JSON.

Here's the truth I wish I'd known from the start: **if you leave Per-Bucket Access Keys enabled you can't modify most bucket policies—period.** Turn that feature off, switch to a regular all-or-nothing access key, and everything snaps into place.

Below is the exact sequence that finally worked for me, with the false turns called out so you don't repeat them.

## 1. Disable Per-Bucket Access Keys (Yes, Really)

DigitalOcean's per-bucket keys sound great on paper: tight scoping, least-privilege, all that good stuff. Unfortunately the current implementation blocks `PutBucketPolicy`, `PutBucketLogging`, and a few other S3 calls—even if the UI insists the key has those permissions.

**Fix:** In the Spaces dashboard, open your bucket ➜ _Settings_ ➜ toggle **Per-Bucket Access Keys** off. Grab a classic Spaces key (or create a new one) that has full account-wide access. Use that for every command below.

_If you're still seeing 403s after this step, double-check that your CLI is using the new key._

## 2. Install `s3cmd` (AWS CLI Works, But `s3cmd` is Friendlier Here)

```bash
# macOS
brew install s3cmd

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install s3cmd
```

Run `s3cmd --configure` and drop in your Spaces key, secret, and region (for me: `sfo3`). When it asks for the endpoint, use `sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com` (swap for your region).

## 3. The No-Drama ACL Method

This is the zero-friction route I recommend.

### a. Make the bucket listable

```bash
s3cmd setacl s3://YOUR_BUCKET --acl-public
```

### b. Flip every existing object to public

```bash
s3cmd setacl s3://YOUR_BUCKET/ --acl-public --recursive
```

### c. Upload new files as public by default

```bash
s3cmd put local-file.jpg s3://YOUR_BUCKET/remote-file.jpg --acl-public
```

That's it. Skip the rest of the post unless you love yak-shaving.

## 4. The JSON Bucket Policy Rabbit Hole (Optional)

Feel like you **must** use a proper policy? Fine—just remember the Per-Bucket Keys warning above.

1. Create `public-policy.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Push it with the AWS CLI (endpoint is mandatory):

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
  --bucket YOUR_BUCKET \
  --endpoint-url https://YOUR_REGION.digitaloceanspaces.com \
  --policy file://public-policy.json
```

If that still throws a 403, triple-check that you're using a non-scoped key.

## 5. Good News: Access Logging is Self-Serve Now

Back in early 2025 you had to open a support ticket to enable server access logging. As of **July 2025** the feature is rolled out for everyone—no ticket required.

Enable it with a single call:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-logging \
  --bucket YOUR_SOURCE_BUCKET \
  --endpoint-url https://YOUR_REGION.digitaloceanspaces.com \
  --bucket-logging-status '{
    "LoggingEnabled": {
      "TargetBucket": "your-log-destination-bucket",
      "TargetPrefix": "logs/"
    }
  }'
```

If you get a 403 here, you already know the likely cause: you forgot to disable Per-Bucket Access Keys.

---

## tl;dr

1. **Turn off Per-Bucket Access Keys.**
2. **Use ACLs** for the fastest public-by-default setup.
3. Policies and access logging work once you're using a full-access key—no more support tickets.
