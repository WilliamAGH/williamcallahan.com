<BackgroundInfo title="Purpose of this Guide">
  Automating sitemap submissions to search engines like Bing (via IndexNow) and Google Search Console ensures they
  discover your content updates faster. This guide details how to set up a Node.js/TypeScript script for this, including
  private key handling and development environment considerations.
</BackgroundInfo>

### Understanding the APIs

#### 1. Google Search Console API

The Google Search Console API allows programmatic interaction with Google Search Console. For sitemap submission, it enables an application to inform Google about new or updated sitemaps without manual intervention in the Search Console interface, which can help Google schedule crawls more efficiently.

#### 2. Bing IndexNow API

IndexNow is an initiative by Microsoft Bing, Yandex, and other search engines allowing websites to notify search engines whenever their website content is created, updated, or deleted. Submitting a sitemap URL via IndexNow alerts participating search engines to update their index with the latest changes quickly. Its setup is generally straightforward.

### Setting Up Sitemap Submissions

#### 1. Set Up Google Service Account & API Access for Sitemap Submission

To submit sitemaps to Google programmatically, a Service Account with access to the Google Search Console API is required. The process involves several steps in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

- **Enable API**: In your GCP project, enable the "Google Search Console API" and optionally the "Search Indexing API." The 'Google Search Console API' is for submitting the sitemap file, while the 'Search Indexing API' can be used for submitting individual URLs for faster updates, if supported by your script.
- **Create Service Account**: In GCP, navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts." Create a new service account with a descriptive name. Granting a project-level role at this stage is typically not necessary for this specific purpose.
- **Download JSON Key**: After creating the service account, generate a JSON key and download it. This file contains the credentials for the script, including the private key and client email. Store this file securely.
- **Grant Search Console Permissions**: In Google Search Console, navigate to your verified property. Go to "Settings" > "Users and permissions." Add a new user with the service account's email address (e.g., `your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). Grant this service account "Owner" or "Full" permission to allow sitemap submissions for that property.

<BackgroundInfo title="Important Note on siteUrl">
  **Important**: The `siteUrl` used in API calls (as shown in script examples) must exactly match a property verified in
  Google Search Console (e.g., `https://your-production-domain.com`). Submissions for properties not associated with the
  service account or against `localhost` will be rejected by the API.
</BackgroundInfo>

#### 2. Prepare IndexNow Verification (Bing)

IndexNow uses a simple verification step. This involves placing a text file in the site's `public` root directory (or equivalent static file directory), where the filename acts as the key.

1.  **Generate/Choose Your Key**: Decide on a unique key string. This will be the value of your `INDEXNOW_KEY` environment variable and the name of the verification file (without the `.txt` extension).
2.  **Create the file**: In your project's `public` directory, create a text file named `YOUR_KEY.txt` (e.g., if your key is `abcdef12345`, create `public/abcdef12345.txt`).
3.  **File content**: The file must contain _only_ the key itself (e.g., `abcdef12345`), with no extra characters, spaces, or the `.txt` extension.

<BackgroundInfo title="Public Accessibility for IndexNow">
  **Accessibility**: This verification file must be publicly accessible on your live domain (e.g.,
  `https://your-production-domain.com/YOUR_KEY.txt`). IndexNow checks for this file to verify submissions. Submissions
  may fail (e.g., with a 403 Forbidden error) if the file is not accessible or if submissions are attempted against
  `localhost`.
</BackgroundInfo>

### Implementing the Submission Script

To automate the submission process, a script, such as one written in Node.js/TypeScript, can be used.

#### 1. Install `googleapis` Client Library (Example)

For interacting with the Google Search Console API, a common library is `googleapis`.

```bash
npm install googleapis
# or: bun install googleapis / yarn add googleapis / pnpm install googleapis
```

#### 2a. Core API Interaction Examples

Below are simplified excerpts demonstrating core interactions with Google Search Console and Bing's IndexNow API. These functions would typically be part of a larger script incorporating comprehensive error handling, environment checks, and authentication setup.

**Submitting to Google Search Console:**

```typescript
import { google, type Auth } from "googleapis";

async function submitSitemapToGoogle(authClient: Auth.JWT, siteUrl: string, sitemapUrl: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Ensure 'webmasters' and 'indexing' scopes are included when creating the authClient
    const webmasters = google.webmasters({ version: "v3", auth: authClient });
    await webmasters.sitemaps.submit({
      siteUrl: siteUrl, // e.g., "https://your-production-domain.com"
      feedpath: sitemapUrl, // e.g., "https://your-production-domain.com/sitemap.xml"
    });
    console.log(
      `[SitemapSubmitGoogle] ✅ Successfully submitted sitemap (${sitemapUrl}) to Google for site ${siteUrl}`,
    );
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    // In a production script, 'error' would likely be an instance of GaxiosError or similar
    // console.error("[SitemapSubmitGoogle] ❌ Error submitting to Google:", error.message, error.response?.data);
    console.error("[SitemapSubmitGoogle] ❌ Error submitting to Google:", error.message);
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Submitting to Bing (IndexNow):**

```typescript
async function submitSitemapToBing(siteUrl: string, sitemapUrl: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const indexNowKey = process.env.INDEXNOW_KEY; // From an environment variable
  if (!indexNowKey) {
    console.error("[SitemapSubmitBing] ❌ INDEXNOW_KEY not set. Skipping Bing/IndexNow submission.");
    return false;
  }
  try {
    const host = new URL(siteUrl).host;
    const indexnowUrl = `https://www.bing.com/indexnow?url=${encodeURIComponent(sitemapUrl)}&key=${indexNowKey}&host=${host}`;
    const response = await fetch(indexnowUrl, { method: "GET" });
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log(`[SitemapSubmitBing] ✅ Successfully submitted sitemap (${sitemapUrl}) via IndexNow to Bing`);
      return true;
    }
    console.error(`[SitemapSubmitBing] ❌ IndexNow submission failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    return false;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[SitemapSubmitBing] ❌ Error submitting via IndexNow to Bing:", error.message);
    return false;
  }
}
```

_Note: The `authClient` for Google requires proper setup with credentials and scopes (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters`). A complete submission script should handle this, along with more comprehensive environment checks._

#### 2. Set Up Submission Script Logic

<BackgroundInfo>
A well-designed submission script might export primary functions such as:

- **`submitSitemapFilesToSearchEngines()`**: Submits a generated `/sitemap.xml` file to both Google Search Console and Bing (IndexNow), respecting production environment checks.
- **`submitIndividualUrlsToGoogle()`**: Iterates sitemap entries (e.g., from a Next.js sitemap), selects recently updated pages (e.g., last 14 days), checks Google's last crawl date for each URL, and resubmits only URLs needing an update.
  </BackgroundInfo>

Once a submission script (e.g., `path/to/your/submit-sitemap.ts`) is prepared with the necessary functions, it can be invoked. The following illustrates a simple runner script:

```typescript
import "dotenv/config"; // For loading environment variables
import { submitSitemapFilesToSearchEngines, submitIndividualUrlsToGoogle } from "./path/to/your/submit-sitemap"; // Adjust path as needed

(async () => {
  await submitSitemapFilesToSearchEngines();
  await submitIndividualUrlsToGoogle(); // Optional, if implementing individual URL submission
})();
```

#### 3. Example: Submitting the Sitemap File Only

```bash
# Example command using Node.js; adapt for your runtime (e.g., Bun, Deno)
node path/to/your/submit-sitemap.ts --sitemaps-only
```

#### 4. Example: Submitting Recently Updated URLs Only

```bash
node path/to/your/submit-sitemap.ts --individual-only
```

#### 5. Example: Submitting Both (Default Behavior)

```bash
node path/to/your/submit-sitemap.ts
```

> **Note on script logic:** A robust script should include logic to skip submissions if `NODE_ENV` is 'development' AND the `SITE_URL` points to localhost. This prevents accidental submissions during local development. It should also log a warning if `NODE_ENV` is 'production' but the `SITE_URL` doesn't match the intended production site URL.

### Configuration & Environment Details

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

The script will rely on environment variables for API keys, service account details, and site URLs. These should be defined in your project's `.env` file (and templated in a `.env.example` or similar).

```bash
# For Bing's IndexNow
# The key chosen/generated for the IndexNow verification file.
INDEXNOW_KEY="your-generated-indexnow-key" # e.g., abcdef12345

# For Google Search Console API (values from the downloaded Service Account JSON key)
# Ensure these variable names match those used in the script.
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
GOOGLE_SEARCH_INDEXING_SA_EMAIL="your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# CRITICAL: GOOGLE_SEARCH_INDEXING_SA_PRIVATE_KEY must be the complete string
# from the "private_key" field in the JSON key file, including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
# and -----END PRIVATE KEY-----. All
 characters from the JSON string must be
# preserved literally within the double quotes.
# The entire multi-line key must be enclosed in a SINGLE pair of double quotes.
GOOGLE_SEARCH_INDEXING_SA_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvg...your...entire...key...goes...here...with...all...the...\n...sequences...preserved...exactly...as...in...the...JSON...file...including...the...final...\n...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# Site's main URL (e.g., your Next.js public URL), used by the script to construct sitemap URLs.
# Ensure this matches a verified property in Google Search Console for Google submissions.
SITE_URL="https://your-production-domain.com" # e.g., https://williamcallahan.com (NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is a common convention for Next.js)

# Node environment, used by the script to conditionally skip submissions.
NODE_ENV="development" # Set to "production" in deployment environments
```

**Key Points for `GOOGLE_SEARCH_INDEXING_SA_PRIVATE_KEY`**:

- Copy the _entire_ string value from the `private_key` field in the downloaded Service Account JSON key.
- This includes `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`, all base64 encoded lines, and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`.
- Crucially, all `
` characters from the JSON string must be preserved as literal `
` sequences within the value in the `.env` file. If the `.env` parser or shell has issues with this, alternative methods like base64 encoding the key for storage and decoding in the script, or using a secrets manager, may be necessary. Direct string with literal `
` is often supported.
- The entire value should be enclosed in a _single pair of double quotes_ in the `.env` file.
- The script logic should process this private key string, replacing `\n` with actual newline characters, which is essential for Google Auth libraries.

#### 2. Automate Script Execution

To ensure sitemaps are submitted regularly or after content updates, integrate the submission script into your workflow:

- **Post-build script**: Run as part of the deployment process after the site and sitemap are built.
- **Scheduled task/Cron job**: Set up a recurring job (e.g., daily) to execute the script.
- **Webhook**: Trigger the script via a webhook from a CMS when content is published or updated.

Example `package.json` script entry:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "submit-sitemaps": "node path/to/your/submit-sitemap.ts"
  }
}
```

This can then be run, for example, with `npm run submit-sitemaps`.

This setup provides a robust and automated way to manage sitemap submissions to Google and Bing, emphasizing critical aspects like private key formatting and differentiating between development and production environments.
