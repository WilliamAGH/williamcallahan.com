<BackgroundInfo title="Overview: Goal & Key Challenges">
This article walks through building an embedded terminal UI with macOS-style window controls (minimize/maximize/close) within a Next.js App Router project (v14/15). The core challenge lay in reliably managing shared window state across different components and routes while sidestepping common hydration errors.
</BackgroundInfo>

## 1: Component Architecture {/* mt-8 */}

Let's look at the key components that make up this system:

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.1: Global State Provider">
  - **Role**: A central hub, implemented using React Context and placed in the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`). It's responsible for managing the state of all registered "window" components.
  - **Source**: [`lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.2: Feature Client Components">
  - **Role**: These represent individual features or pages (like Blog or Experience sections) that need to behave like independent windows.
  - **Integration**: They use a custom hook (`useRegisteredWindowState`) to connect to the global provider. This hook gives them access to their specific state (`windowState`) and the functions to change it (`minimize`, `maximize`, etc.).
  - **Source (Hook)**: [`useRegisteredWindowState` in `GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx#L142)
  - **Source (Example)**: [`components/features/blog/blog.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/features/blog/blog.tsx)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.3: Floating Restore Buttons">
  - **Role**: This component reads the global state to display buttons at the screen's bottom, allowing users to restore any windows they've minimized or closed.
  - **Source**: [`components/ui/window/FloatingRestoreButtons.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/window/FloatingRestoreButtons.tsx)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.4: Terminal Component">
  - **Role**: The main interactive terminal UI itself. Importantly, it's also registered as a window using the same hook, allowing it to be controlled just like other feature windows.
  - **Source**: [`components/ui/terminal/terminal.client.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/terminal/terminal.client.tsx)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.5: Window Control Buttons">
  - **Role**: Provides the familiar macOS-style UI buttons (red/yellow/green) for standard window actions.
  - **Integration**: It's a straightforward UI component that accepts callback functions (`onMinimize`, `onMaximize`, `onClose`) provided by the parent window component (which usually gets them from the registration hook).
  - **Source**: [`components/ui/navigation/window-controls.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/navigation/window-controls.tsx)

## 2: Window State Management {/* mt-8 */}

Handling the state of multiple 'windows' (like normal, minimized, or maximized) across different pages presented a challenge. Simple component-local state didn't scale well and led to tricky hydration issues.

<BackgroundInfo title="The Problem: Local State & Hydration Conflicts">
Initial attempts using component-local state, even persisting with `localStorage`, resulted in hydration mismatches â€“ the UI rendered on the server didn't match the client-side state after JavaScript loaded. This approach also proved cumbersome for managing several independent windows. The robust solution involves a global registry pattern using React Context.
</BackgroundInfo>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.1: Global Context Details">
  - **How it's Made**: Defined using `React.createContext`.
  - **What it Holds**: A central record (a JavaScript object) mapping unique window IDs to their current information (like `id`, `icon`, `title`, and `state`).
  - **What it Provides**: Access to the shared `windows` state record and functions to manage windows (`registerWindow`, `setWindowState`, etc.).
  - **Source**: [`lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.2: Provider Implementation">
  - **Where it Lives**: The Provider component wraps the `RootLayout` in `app/layout.tsx`, ensuring the context is available throughout the application.
  - **State Keeping**: It uses `useState` internally to hold and update the central `windows` record.
  - **Syncing with CSS**: A client-side `useEffect` hook (carefully checking `isMounted` to avoid server-side execution) dynamically adds `window-maximized` or `window-minimized` classes to the `<body>` tag. This clever trick allows global CSS to subtly adjust shared layout elements (like hiding secondary header icons) based on the overall window state, without complex prop drilling.

  ```tsx
  // app/layout.tsx (Simplified Example)
  import { GlobalWindowRegistryProvider } from '@/lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext';
  import { FloatingRestoreButtons } from "@/components/ui/window/FloatingRestoreButtons";
  import { ClientTerminal } from '@/components/ui/terminal/terminal.client';
  // ... other imports

  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body>
          <Providers>{/* ThemeProvider, etc. */}
            <GlobalWindowRegistryProvider>
              {/* ... header, other layout elements ... */}
              <main>
                <ClientTerminal /> {/* Registered window, uses context */}
                {children} {/* Page content, potentially containing other registered windows */}
              </main>
              <FloatingRestoreButtons /> {/* Reads context for minimized/closed windows */}
            </GlobalWindowRegistryProvider>
          </Providers>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```
  (See the full [`app/layout.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/app/layout.tsx))
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.3: Registration Hook Details">
  - **Purpose**: This hook acts as the main way for individual components to "sign up" with the global registry, get their current state, and receive functions to modify that state.
  - **How it Works**: It's a custom hook (`useRegisteredWindowState`) encapsulating the logic to consume the global context and handle the registration/unregistration process cleanly.
  - **Automatic Cleanup**: It uses `useEffect` to ensure a window automatically registers when its component mounts and unregisters when it unmounts, preventing memory leaks.
  - **What it Returns**: Crucially, it gives the component its specific `windowState`, ready-to-use action functions (`minimize`, `maximize`, etc.), and the vital `isRegistered` flag to ensure rendering only happens safely after hydration.
  - **Source**: [`useRegisteredWindowState` in `GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx#L142)

  ```typescript
  // lib/context/GlobalWindowRegistryContext.tsx (Conceptual Hook Snippet)
  export const useRegisteredWindowState = ( // Actual implementation linked above
    id: string,
    icon: React.ReactNode,
    title: string,
    initialState: WindowState = 'normal'
  ): RegisteredWindowState => {
    const { registerWindow, unregisterWindow, windows, ...actions } = useWindowRegistry();
    const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false); // Track client-side mount

    useEffect(() => {
      setIsMounted(true); // Set mounted on client
      // Register on mount
      registerWindow(id, icon, title, initialState);
      // Unregister on unmount
      return () => {
        unregisterWindow(id);
      };
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
    }, [id, title, initialState, registerWindow, unregisterWindow]); // icon excluded intentionally if static

    const windowInfo = windows[id];
    const currentState = windowInfo?.state ?? initialState;

    // Memoize to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    const boundActions = useMemo(() => ({
      minimize: () => actions.minimizeWindow(id),
      maximize: () => actions.maximizeWindow(id),
      close: () => actions.closeWindow(id),
      restore: () => actions.restoreWindow(id),
      setState: (state: WindowState) => actions.setWindowState(id, state),
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
    }), [id, /* actions dependencies */]);

    return useMemo(() => ({
      windowState: currentState,
      // Only consider registered after client-side mount AND windowInfo exists
      isRegistered: isMounted && !!windowInfo,
      ...boundActions,
    }), [currentState, isMounted, windowInfo, boundActions]);
  };
  ```
</CollapseDropdown>

<BackgroundInfo title="Key Implementation Points">
- **Avoiding Hydration Errors**: Always check the `isRegistered` flag (which confirms client-side mounting and context availability) before rendering UI based on `windowState`. Render a default or loading state until `isRegistered` becomes true. This is key to preventing server/client mismatches.
- **Self-Contained Layout**: Each window component is responsible for its own layout styling (`position: fixed`, dimensions, z-index) based on its current `windowState`.
- **Handling Minimized/Closed**: When a window is minimized or closed, its component typically renders `null`. The separate `FloatingRestoreButtons` component takes care of the UI needed to bring them back.
- **Targeted Global CSS**: The `body.window-maximized` and `body.window-minimized` classes are used sparingly. Their main job is to adjust shared elements (like the site header) without interfering with the individual layout logic within each window component.

## 3: Server/Client Data Flow {/* mt-8 */}

Getting data fetched on the server into these interactive client components wasn't straightforward, especially when dealing with data that isn't easily passed between server and client.

<BackgroundInfo title="The Problem: Non-Serializable Data Across Boundaries">
Trying to pass complex data structures (like ready-made JSX elements or objects containing functions) directly from Server Components to Client Components leads to errors. This happens because the data crossing the Server-Client boundary must be serializable (convertible to JSON). Things like functions or certain complex objects can't be serialized, causing issues like `fs` module errors on the client or breaking Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
</BackgroundInfo>

<CollapseDropdown summary="The Solution: Keep Server Logic on the Server">
  The reliable way to handle this is to perform all server-specific work on the server and only pass clean, serializable data to the client:
  1.  **Isolate Server Logic**: Create utility functions designed *only* for server execution (using `import "server-only"` is a good practice). These handle tasks like fetching from databases, calling external APIs, or reading local files (like SVGs). They process this raw data into a simple format.
  2.  **Orchestrate in Server Component**: The main Server Component for a feature (e.g., the page component for `/education`) calls these server-only utilities. It gathers all the needed data and ensures it's fully processed into a serializable structure (like plain JavaScript objects or arrays).
  3.  **Pass Clean Data**: This processed, serializable data is then passed as props to the top-level Client Component wrapper for that feature.
  4.  **Render on Client**: The Client Component wrapper receives this clean data. It then imports and renders the necessary *client-side* UI sub-components, passing the data down as props for them to display.

  This strict separation prevents server-only code or non-serializable data from ever trying to run on or be sent to the client.

## 4: Auto-Scrolling Terminal {/* mt-8 */}

To make the terminal automatically scroll down as new output appears, the implementation uses a couple of standard React techniques:

<CollapseDropdown summary="How it Works">
  - A `useRef` hook is used to get a direct reference to the scrollable container element in the terminal's DOM.
  - A `useEffect` hook watches for changes in the command history (which is managed in a separate `TerminalContext`).
  - Whenever the command history updates (meaning new output has been added), the `useEffect` triggers and programmatically sets the container's `scrollTop` to its `scrollHeight`. This effectively scrolls the view to the very bottom, ensuring the latest output is always visible.
  - **Source**: Scrolling logic in [`components/ui/terminal/terminal.tsx`](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/terminal/terminal.tsx).

## 5: Command Handling {/* mt-8 */}

To keep command processing logic organized and maintainable, it's centralized:

<CollapseDropdown summary="How Commands Are Processed">
  - When the user enters input, it's captured by the terminal component.
  - A `useTerminal` hook ([source](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/terminal/use-terminal.ts)) takes the submitted command string and passes it off to an asynchronous `handleCommand` function.
  - This central `handleCommand` function ([source](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/components/ui/terminal/commands.ts)) is responsible for:
      - Parsing the input string to identify the command and any arguments.
      - Matching the command against a list of predefined commands or known application routes.
      - Performing the appropriate action based on the match, such as:
          - Returning formatted text output directly (e.g., for a `help` command).
          - Calling separate search logic ([source](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/blob/dev/lib/search.ts)) for commands like `search` or `find`.
          - Using Next.js's `useRouter` to trigger client-side navigation for commands that map to page routes (e.g., `cd blog`).
          - Returning specific error messages if the command is invalid or arguments are missing.
</CollapseDropdown>

<BackgroundInfo title="Summary: Key Takeaways & Solutions">
- **Global State for UI**: For managing shared UI state (like window positions and status) across different routes in the Next.js App Router, a global React Context provider placed in the root layout is a very effective pattern.
- **Handling Hydration**: The custom hook pattern (`useRegisteredWindowState`) combined with an `isRegistered` flag (checking mount status and context availability) is crucial for safely managing client-side state and preventing hydration errors.
- **Server/Client Data Integrity**: Maintaining a strict separation between server-side data fetching/processing and client-side rendering is key. Always ensure only serializable data is passed from server to client components to avoid errors and ensure stability.
