Here's a quick guide to setup `JAVA_HOME` on macOS with zshrc and configure it in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Checking Your Java Version

First, let's verify the Java version installed on your system. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
java --version
```

You should see something like:

```plaintext
openjdk 23.0.2 2025-01-21
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 23.0.2+7-58)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0.2+7-58, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Setting JAVA_HOME in zshrc

To set `JAVA_HOME`, you'll need to edit your `.zshrc` file. This file is located in your home directory. You can open it with your favorite text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following line to set `JAVA_HOME`:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
```

This command dynamically sets `JAVA_HOME` to the current Java version's home directory.

After saving the changes, apply them by running:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Verifying the Setup

Finally, verify that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly by running:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

You should see the path to your Java installation, confirming that everything is set up correctly.

## Configuring IntelliJ IDEA

In IntelliJ IDEA, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for your projects. Go to **File > Project Structure > SDKs** and ensure the correct JDK is selected.

To set `JAVA_HOME` globally in IntelliJ, navigate to **Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > Path Variables** and add a new variable:

- **Name**: `JAVA_HOME`
- **Value**: `/Users/williamcallahan/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-23.0.2/Contents/Home`

This ensures IntelliJ uses the correct Java version for all your projects.
