<BackgroundInfo title="Overview: UML Diagramming in JetBrains IDEs">
JetBrains IDEs like [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) provide built-in tools to generate UML class diagrams from source code. This relies on the "Diagrams" plugin, which is bundled and enabled by default in these editions. Community editions do not include this feature. WebStorm's diagramming is limited and does not provide full UML class diagram support for JavaScript/TypeScript.

</BackgroundInfo>

## 1: Understanding Built-in UML Diagramming

JetBrains IDEs generate UML class diagrams from code. These are not general-purpose UML modeling tools and do not support designing diagrams before code ("model-first" means creating diagrams and generating code from them; JetBrains tools only generate diagrams from existing code).

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.1: What it is">
  The built-in UML diagramming tool generates **Class Diagrams** showing classes and their relationships (inheritance, dependencies) as found in your code. While the initial diagram provides a structural overview based on your source, you often need to use the diagram editor's tools to [manage and populate the diagram with specific members (fields, methods) and refine connections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/class-diagram.html#manage_class_diagram) to achieve a comprehensive view. It's a way to visualize and navigate your existing codebase rather than a design-first modeling tool.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.2: Key Considerations">
  - **Code-First**: Diagrams reflect the current state of your code. Some refactoring (like renaming) can be performed from the diagram.
  - **Plugin**: The "Diagrams" plugin must be enabled (Settings/Preferences > Plugins).
  - **Editions**: Requires IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or PyCharm Professional. WebStorm does not provide full UML class diagram support for JS/TS.
</CollapseDropdown>

## 2: How to Generate UML Class Diagrams

The process for generating UML class diagrams is as follows:

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.1: IntelliJ IDEA (Java/Kotlin)">
  - Right-click a package, class, or multiple classes in the Project tool window.
  - Select **Diagrams > Show Diagram...** (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U` on Windows/Linux, `⌥⇧⌘U` on macOS).
  - If prompted, select **Java Class Diagram**.
  - The diagram opens in a new editor tab.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.2: PyCharm (Python)">
  - Right-click a Python file, class, or package in the Project tool window.
  - Select **Diagrams > Show Diagram...**.
  - Select **Python Class Diagram**.
  - The diagram opens in a new editor tab.
  - PyCharm can also visualize database schemas (separate from UML class diagrams).
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.3: WebStorm and IntelliJ support for JavaScript/TypeScript">
  While WebStorm doesn't include built-in UML class diagram support for JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use the third-party plugin [UML JavaScript and TypeScript](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17380-uml-javascript-and-typescript) to add this functionality to any IntelliJ IDE:

  - Install the plugin from Settings/Preferences > Plugins > Marketplace
  - Right-click a JavaScript/TypeScript file or directory in the Project tool window
  - Select **Diagrams > Show Diagram...**
  - Select **JavaScript Class Diagram** or **TypeScript Class Diagram**
  - The diagram opens in a new editor tab
</CollapseDropdown>

## 3: What Built-in UML Diagrams Can Do

<CollapseDropdown summary="3.1: Key Features and Capabilities">
  - Visualize classes, interfaces, enums, and their members (fields, methods) with visibility modifiers (requires interaction with diagram tools to display specific elements and set visibility levels).
  - Show inheritance, implementation, and dependencies.
  - Double-click to navigate to source code.
  - Some refactorings (e.g., renaming) can be performed from the diagram.
  - Toggle member visibility, filter by visibility, show/hide dependencies, rearrange layout.
  - Export diagrams as images (PNG, SVG).
  - Add classes to the diagram (press `Space` in the diagram editor).
  - Refine and manage the diagram by showing/hiding specific members, adjusting visibility levels, and manually adding or arranging elements and relationships using the [diagram editor's context menu and toolbar](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/class-diagram.html#manage_class_diagram).
  - IntelliJ IDEA offers graph analysis features (focus on paths, measure node centrality).

## 7: Easiest Ways to Generate Full UML Diagrams Today

Generating a *full* and detailed UML diagram often involves a combination of automated tools and manual refinement. The "easiest" way depends on your specific needs and the tools at your disposal. Here are some approaches across different environments, considering options with and without direct AI assistance:

### 7.1: In JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm)

<CollapseDropdown summary="Without AI">
  - **Built-in Diagrams (IntelliJ Ultimate, PyCharm Pro):** As covered in section 2, use **Diagrams > Show Diagram...** (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U` or `⌥⇧⌘U`). This provides an excellent starting point generated directly from your existing code. You'll then use the [diagram editor tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/class-diagram.html#manage_class_diagram) to show specific members (fields, methods), adjust visibility, add notes, and refine relationships to build out the complete details. For many, this is the most integrated and straightforward approach.
  - **Marketplace Plugins for Text-Based Diagrams:** Install plugins for tools like [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). This allows you to write UML diagrams using a simple text-based syntax, which the plugin then renders within the IDE. This method offers precise control and is great for versioning diagrams with your code.
  - **Language-Specific Plugins:** The "[UML JavaScript and TypeScript](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17380-uml-javascript-and-typescript)" plugin is a good example for adding specific UML capabilities for web projects.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="With AI Assistance">
  - **AI Coding Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot in JetBrains, JetBrains AI Assistant):** While direct AI-driven UML *generation* into the graphical editor is still evolving, AI assistants are incredibly helpful:
    - **Generate Diagram-as-Code:** Select a class or describe a set of interactions to your AI assistant and ask it to generate the PlantUML or Mermaid syntax. You can then paste this into a relevant file and use a PlantUML plugin (if installed) to visualize it.
    - **Explain Code:** Ask the AI to explain complex classes, inheritance hierarchies, or relationships. This understanding can significantly speed up manual refinement of diagrams generated by the built-in tool or when creating text-based diagrams.
    - **Refine Diagrams:** Describe what you want to see or change in a diagram, and the AI can suggest how to use the IDE's features or what PlantUML syntax to write.
</CollapseDropdown>

### 7.2: In VS Code

<CollapseDropdown summary="Without AI">
  - **PlantUML Extension:** Install the official [PlantUML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml). Write PlantUML syntax in `.plantuml`, `.puml`, or Markdown files (using code fences), and the extension will render the diagram. This is a very popular and powerful method for creating version-controlled UML diagrams.
  - **Mermaid Support:** VS Code has excellent built-in [Mermaid support in Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/08/16/mermaid-diagrams), and extensions like "[Markdown Mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)" or dedicated "[Mermaid Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bpruitt-goddard.mermaid-markdown-syntax-highlighting)" enhance this. Mermaid is often simpler for sequence or flow charts but also supports class diagrams effectively.
  - **Draw.io Integration:** The "[Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)" extension lets you create and edit diagrams (including UML) directly within VS Code using the draw.io interface.
  - **Language-Specific Diagrammers:** Search the VS Code Marketplace for extensions that might offer automated diagram generation from code for your specific language (e.g., Python call graphs, Java class visualizers).
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="With AI Assistance">
  - **AI Coding Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codeium, Figstack, Amazon CodeWhisperer):**
    - **Generate PlantUML/Mermaid Code:** This is a very effective use of AI in VS Code. Select a piece of code, or describe a system architecture, and ask the AI assistant to generate the PlantUML or Mermaid syntax for a class diagram, sequence diagram, etc. You can then paste this into the appropriate file or Markdown code fence for rendering.
    - **Explain Code for Manual Diagramming:** Use the AI to get summaries of files, classes, and their interactions to accelerate manual diagramming using tools like the Draw.io extension or text-based approaches.
  - **Emerging AI Diagramming Extensions:** The field is evolving rapidly. Keep an eye on the VS Code Marketplace for new extensions that explicitly use AI to generate or assist with UML diagrams directly from your codebase.
</CollapseDropdown>

### 7.3: From a GitHub Repository (Online/Standalone Tools)

<CollapseDropdown summary="Without AI">
  - **[GitUML](https://gituml.com/):** As highlighted in section 6.2, this tool can generate diagrams directly from your Git repository. For public repositories, it's often free and can be one of the quickest ways to get an initial visualization of your codebase structure.
  - **Dedicated UML Tools with Repository Import:** Tools like [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/), [StarUML](https://staruml.io/), or [Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect](https://sparxsystems.com/) (mentioned in 6.2) can often clone or import code from a repository and offer more powerful reverse engineering capabilities to generate detailed diagrams.
  - **PlantUML + Scripting:** Clone the repository locally. For more customized or large-scale diagram generation, you can write scripts (e.g., using Python, shell scripts) to parse your code and automatically generate PlantUML files. These can then be rendered using a PlantUML processor.
  - **Online Diagramming Tools (e.g., [draw.io / diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)):** Clone the repo, analyze the code structure, and then manually create diagrams. While manual, these tools are flexible and widely accessible.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="With AI Assistance">
  - **AI-Powered Code Analysis Platforms that Integrate with GitHub:** Several online platforms are emerging that use AI to analyze entire repositories. They might offer UML-like diagrams, code visualizations, or generate documentation that aids in understanding structure:
    - Search for terms like "AI code visualization GitHub" or "AI software architecture diagram GitHub" to find current tools. Some may directly output PlantUML or other diagram formats.
  - **GitUML (with potential AI features):** Tools like GitUML may incorporate AI or advanced analytics to improve diagram generation and code understanding. Check their latest features.
  - **AI Assistants + Cloned Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine. Use an AI coding assistant within your preferred IDE (as described in sections 7.1 and 7.2) to analyze parts of the codebase and generate PlantUML/Mermaid syntax. This combines the power of local IDEs with AI for repository-wide understanding.
  - **Custom Scripts with LLM APIs:** For advanced users, you can write scripts that use Large Language Model (LLM) APIs (like OpenAI's) to parse code from a cloned repository and generate diagram descriptions or PlantUML/Mermaid code.
