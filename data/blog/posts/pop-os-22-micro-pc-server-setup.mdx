I use a lot of checklists -- here's another one of mine, this time for setting up a PC / server with Pop!_OS. While these instructions are written specifically for Pop!_OS, they should work similarly for Ubuntu with minor adjustments.

## Pre-Installation Steps

### 1. BIOS Configuration

Most modern PCs require disabling Secure Boot and TPM/device security features to install Linux distributions. To access BIOS:

1. Power on your PC
2. Immediately press and hold the `Delete` key
   - If that doesn't work, try tapping `F2`, `F8`, or `F12` during startup
   - Different manufacturers use different keys, but `Delete` is increasingly common

Navigate to:
- Security/Boot section
- Disable "Secure Boot"
- Disable "TPM Security" if present
- Save changes and exit

### 2. Boot Order Configuration

While still in BIOS:
1. Navigate to Boot Order/Boot Priority section
2. Move USB drive to the top of the boot order
3. Save changes and exit

### 3. Prepare Installation Media

1. Download the OS:
   - [Pop!_OS 22.04](https://pop.system76.com/)
   - Or [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) if you prefer
2. Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create bootable USB
3. Use Etcher to flash the OS image to your USB drive

## Installation Process

### Partitioning Guide

When you reach the disk partitioning step, here's how to set up your partitions:

> Why These Partitions?
> - EFI partition stores bootloader files
> - Root partition holds your OS and all data
> - Modern systems with sufficient RAM often don't need swap

#### EFI System Partition
```bash
Partition Name: EFI
Label: EFI
Create as: Primary Partition
File System: fat32
Mount point: /boot/efi
Size: 1GB  # Being generous for safety
```

#### Root Partition
```bash
Partition Name: Root
Label: Pop_OS
Create as: Primary Partition
File System: ext4
Mount point: /
Size: Remaining space
```

ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Leave 10MB free space before and after partitions for potential future adjustments.

## Post-Installation Setup

### System Updates

> APT vs Pop!_Shop
> Pop!_OS uses APT for CLI package management and Pop!_Shop for GUI. Stick to one to avoid conflicts - I prefer APT for servers.

```bash
# Update package lists and upgrade system
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Setting Hostname
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME
```

### SSH Server Setup

> Why SSH?
> SSH provides secure remote access to your server. Using key-based authentication is more secure than passwords.

```bash
# Install SSH server
sudo apt install openssh-server

# Configure SSH
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add/modify these lines:
```bash
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Set up SSH keys:
```bash
# Create .ssh directory
sudo mkdir -p ~/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Add your public key
echo "your-public-key" > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# For root (if needed)
sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
sudo cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/
sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Docker Installation

> Why Docker?
> Docker containers provide isolated environments for running applications, making deployment and management easier.

Follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for the latest instructions.

### AppImage Management
```bash
# Create applications directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/applications

# For each AppImage:
chmod +x your-app.AppImage
sudo mv your-app.AppImage /opt/applications/

# Create desktop entry
cat << EOF > ~/.local/share/applications/your-app.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Your App Name
Exec=/opt/applications/your-app.AppImage
Icon=/path/to/icon.png
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
EOF
```

### Set Micro as Default Editor
```bash
# Install Micro
sudo apt install micro

# Set as default editor
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor /usr/local/bin/micro 100
sudo update-alternatives --config editor

# Configure for git
echo 'export VISUAL=micro' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export EDITOR=micro' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Enable Automatic Reboot
```bash
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

## Essential Tools Installation

Here's my curated list of must-have tools for development:

| Tool | Description | Installation |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) | Package manager | `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` |
| [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) | Git TUI | `brew install lazygit` |
| [Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) | Docker TUI | `brew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker` |
| [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org) | JavaScript runtime | `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh \| bash` |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) | Fast package manager | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| [Python](https://python.org) | Python runtime | `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` |
| [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) | Python app installer | `python3 -m pip install --user pipx` |
| [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | Fast Python packager | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| [Warp](https://warp.dev) | Modern terminal | Visit [warp.dev](https://warp.dev) for installation |
| [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io) | Terminal editor | `sudo apt install micro` |

Remember to test all services and configurations before considering the setup complete. This checklist has served me well in setting up numerous servers - I hope it helps you too!
