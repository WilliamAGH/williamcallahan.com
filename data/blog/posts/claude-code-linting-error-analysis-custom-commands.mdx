I found myself doing a lot of manual linting and copy-pasting stack traces... and was elated when I discovered my beloved Claude Code CLI tool had some cool scripting/command functionality that was just the ticket for some quasi-automation.

And while Claude Code has many tools and agentic behaviors of its own built in behind the scenes, commands are a great way (in my opinion) to dip your toes into agentic behavior for coding.

Below I show how I've been customizing [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart), Anthropic's command-line companion, to squeeze the most productivity out of its tool chain and multi-agent skills.

<BackgroundInfo title="Intro to Claude Code in Your CLI">
Stop context-switching between your editor and terminal. Claude Code's built-in **/analyze** plus custom slash commands like **/project:lint** bring static analysis, error tracing, and project-specific helpers directly into your CLI workflow.
</BackgroundInfo>

> **In practice** I combine Claude Code's CLI (see the [Quickstart](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)) with custom Zen MCP tools to automate repetitive checks before every commit. The slash-command system ([reference](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)) plus the SDK's `-p` print mode let me treat Claude like any other Unix utility. The four scripts below show how I wire Claude into my workflow for PR reviews, build triage, lint aggregation, and Jest debugging.

## 0. Getting Started

<CollapseDropdown summary="0.1 Install & launch" id="install-launch">
- **Install globally**:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```
- **Launch in any repository**:
  ```bash
  claude
  ```
- **Docs & download**: [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
</CollapseDropdown>

Here are some ways I'm currently using Claude Code:

## 1. Basic Out-of-the-Box Linting

Claude Code provides basic linting capabilities using environment defaults, and custom commands offer tailored behavior for your specific project setup.

## 1.1 Linting with a Custom Command

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.1 /lint at a glance" id="lint-at-a-glance">
- **Purpose**: Runs your linter(s) via a custom slash command—perfect for ESLint, Flake8, golangci-lint, etc.
- **Syntax**: `/lint [path] [--fix]`
- **Note**: Claude displays the scope as a suffix, e.g., `/lint (project)` or `/lint (user)` based on where you saved the command
- **Docs**: [Slash Commands – Custom Commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
</CollapseDropdown>

```bash
# Check staged files, fix if possible
a$ /lint --fix
✅ Fixed 3 ESLint errors, 1 TypeScript warning
```

<BackgroundInfo title="Built-in vs custom commands">
Claude Code offers basic linting using environment defaults (like `/analyze` for error diagnosis), and custom commands provide behavior tailored to your project setup.

**Automatic scope detection**: When you type a command like `/lint`, Claude displays it with the scope as a suffix in parentheses—e.g., `/lint (project)` for repo-scoped commands or `/lint (user)` for personal commands—based on where the command file is located.

**npm scripts are different**: An entry like  
```json
"lint:claude": "claude -p '…'"
```  
executes Claude once in print mode and then exits; it doesn't launch the interactive REPL. If you need to keep chatting, either run `claude -c` afterward to reopen the last session or start an interactive session first (`claude`) and invoke your slash commands there.
</BackgroundInfo>

## 2. Instant Error Diagnosis

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.1 /analyze" id="analyze-command"> 
- **Purpose**: Given a stack trace or failing test output, Claude pinpoints the source file, probable cause, and suggests a minimal fix.
- **Usage**: Pipe any stderr/stdout into the command.
- **Docs**: [Slash Commands – /analyze](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
</CollapseDropdown>

```bash
# Example: detect why tests fail
a$ npm test 2>&1 | claude -p "/analyze"
```

Claude responds with a ranked list of root-cause candidates, including linked code excerpts and one-line fix suggestions.

## 3. Crafting Custom Commands

<CollapseDropdown summary="3.1 The recipe – Markdown Commands" id="recipe">
1. **Create the directory** (once per repo):  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   ```
   
2. **Add a Markdown file** named after your command—**`prune-branches.md`**, **`lint.md`**, etc.  
   The file's contents become the prompt that Claude will run.

   ```markdown
   <!-- prune-branches.md example -->
   Delete all local branches that have already been merged into main.
   ```
3. **Reload Claude** inside the REPL with `/reload` (or simply restart the CLI).  

4. **Docs**: See [Slash Commands – Custom Commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) for namespacing (`/project:` vs `/user:`) and `$ARGUMENTS` usage.
</CollapseDropdown>

> You can store commands **globally** in `~/.claude/commands/` or keep them **project-scoped** in `.claude/commands/`. Claude automatically detects the scope and displays it as a suffix, e.g., `/commit (user)` or `/commit (project)`. See the [slash-command docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) for details on scoping.

<BackgroundInfo title="Home vs Project Scopes — Quick Reference">
• **Filename ➜ Command name**: the Markdown file's basename (minus `.md`) becomes your command name.

| Where you save the file | Example file | How to run it | How Claude displays it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal scope (works in every repo) | `~/.claude/commands/commit.md` | `/commit` | `/commit (user)` |
| Project scope (only in current repo) | `.claude/commands/commit.md` | `/commit` | `/commit (project)` |

**Tip**: If you create sub-directories, the folder path becomes part of the command—e.g. `.claude/commands/deploy/staging.md` ⇒ `/deploy/staging (project)`.
</BackgroundInfo>

<BackgroundInfo title="Alternative: Package.json Scripts">
You could also add Claude commands to your `package.json` (or equivalent) as scripts, but this approach has limitations:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:claude": "claude -p 'Run ESLint and fix all issues found'"
  }
}
```

**But the issues/drawbacks are currently:**

- **No interactive REPL** - runs once and exits, no "conversation"
- **No tool access** - can't use MCP servers, Edit tools, etc.
- **No multi-step workflows** - single prompt only
- **Awkward continuation** - must use `claude -c` to resume conversation

**Best practices if using scripts:**

- Write very detailed, comprehensive prompts hoping Claude gets it right in one shot
- Use `claude -c` afterward if you need to continue the conversation
- Consider this mainly for simple, one-shot tasks rather than complex workflows

**Recommendation:** Stick with slash commands for the rich, interactive experience your complex recipes require.

## 4. Template Command Recipes Ideas

Here are some "commands" I'm currently using and finding very helpful that I personally wrote, I hope you find them helpful!

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.1 /doublecheck – AI Pull-Request Review" id="user-doublecheck">
Invoke your personal **doublecheck** command to analyze the current diff against `main` for bugs, outdated APIs, and more.

```bash
/doublecheck
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/doublecheck.md -->
You are a code reviewer.

STEP 1: Output the full git diff vs main branch.

STEP 2: Analyze and identify:

1) Potential bugs or logic errors
2) Usage of deprecated or outdated API methods
3) Security vulnerabilities
4) Performance issues

Use web search and available MCP servers to verify API usage against current documentation.

STEP 3: For each issue found, use the Edit or MultiEdit tools to implement the fix directly in the codebase.

STEP 4: After all fixes are applied, run git diff again to show the changes made.

Output a summary of all fixes implemented.
```
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.2 /build – Build Log Triage" id="user-build">
Run your **build** helper to execute `bun run build`, surface errors, and iterate until the build is clean.

```bash
/build
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/build.md -->
Run the build command and analyze any errors or warnings.

First, execute: bun run build

STEP 1: Output the full build log for reference.
STEP 2: Analyze the build output using @mcp__zen__thinkdeep with model="pro".
STEP 3: If there are errors: explain, read, edit, document.
STEP 4: If build succeeds but warnings exist, fix those too.
STEP 5: Re-run the build to verify.
```
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.3 /full-lint – Deep Lint Aggregation" id="user-full-lint">
Run every linter plus type-checker, then let Claude fix issues in priority order.

```bash
/full-lint
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/full-lint.md -->
Run comprehensive linting and type checking, then fix all issues found.

First, run Biome, ESLint, and the TypeScript checker.
STEP 1: Output results.
STEP 2: Deep analysis via thinkdeep.
STEP 3: Fix categorized issues with Read/Edit tools.
STEP 4: Re-run all linters to confirm.
```
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.4 /test – Jest Failure Forensics" id="user-test">
Run Jest, debug failures, and ask about coverage improvements.

```bash
/test
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/test.md -->
Run all tests and fix any failures. After 100% of tests are passing, ask the user if they wish to create/improve tests with low coverage.

First, execute: bun run test

STEP 1: Output the full test results.

STEP 2: Perform deep analysis using @mcp__zen__thinkdeep with model="pro" and thinking_mode="high".

STEP 3: For test failures:
a) Use @mcp__zen__debug to identify root causes
b) Use Read tool to examine failing tests and implementation
c) Use Edit/MultiEdit to fix failing tests or implementation bugs
d) Document each fix

STEP 4: If all tests pass (100% passing):
a) Ask the user if they want to improve test coverage
b) If yes, thoroughly examine the functionality of code with low coverage using Read tool
c) Only after understanding the functionality completely, propose new tests
d) Never create tests without thorough understanding of what is being tested

STEP 5: Run "bun run test" again to verify all tests pass.

Output final test results and all changes made.
```

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.5 /pr-review – Systematically Address PR Comments" id="user-pr-review">
Systematically review and address unresolved comments on GitHub pull requests, making thoughtful decisions about which suggestions to implement.

```bash
/pr-review [PR_NUMBER]
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/pr-review.md -->
# PR Review Command

**Purpose**: Systematically review and address unresolved comments on GitHub pull requests, making thoughtful decisions about which suggestions to implement.

**What this does**:

- Fetches only unresolved review comments from a PR using GraphQL
- Analyzes each suggestion for genuine code improvement
- Implements beneficial changes with proper validation
- Replies to comments and marks threads as resolved

**Repository**: <https://github.com/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com>

**Project Constants**:

- Owner: `WilliamAGH`
- Repo: `williamcallahan.com`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **ALWAYS CHECK THE QUERY OUTPUT CAREFULLY** - If there are JSON objects in the output, THOSE ARE UNRESOLVED COMMENTS!
2. **DO NOT RE-PROCESS ALREADY RESOLVED COMMENTS** - Only process comments where `isResolved == false`
3. **GraphQL for fetching/resolving** - REST API fails with token limits (GitHub MCP lacks GraphQL support)
4. **REST API for comment replies** - GitHub's GraphQL lacks working reply mutation (see note below)
5. **MANDATORY validation before EVERY commit:** `bun run lint && bun run type-check && bun run biome:check`
6. **Fix ALL language server warnings** - Including biome, ESLint, TypeScript diagnostics in modified files
7. **COMMIT MESSAGE RULES - ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS:**
   - **NEVER COMBINE MULTIPLE FILES IN ONE COMMIT**
   - **EACH FILE GETS ITS OWN COMMIT WITH SPECIFIC MESSAGE**
   - Format: `fix(scope): specific change description`
   - Examples:
     - ✅ `fix(eslint): re-enable jsx-no-target-blank rule with allowReferrer`
     - ✅ `fix(bookmarks): replace globalThis lock checks with distributed lock`
     - ❌ `fix(lint): resolve eslint issues` (TOO GENERIC)
     - ❌ `fix: multiple fixes` (ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN)
   - **SCOPE**: Must be the specific area/file being changed
   - **DESCRIPTION**: Must describe the EXACT change, not generic "fix issues"
8. **Deep analysis REQUIRED** - Review comments are suggestions, not orders

## 🧠 DEEP THINKING PROTOCOL

Before implementing ANY suggestion:

1. Find functionality in `docs/projects/file-overview-map.md` → `docs/projects/structure/<functionality>.md`
2. Analyze: Is this actually an improvement? What are the risks? Better alternatives?
3. Get second opinion:

```text
@mcp__zen__thinkdeep model="pro" thinking_mode="high" prompt="
Comment: [paste]
File: [path] | Functionality: [from docs]
Current: [explain] | Suggested: [what they want]
Analyze: 1) Improvement? 2) Risks? 3) Alternatives? 4) Edge cases?"
```

## 📋 WORKFLOW

### ⚠️ COMMIT WORKFLOW - FOLLOW EXACTLY

When fixing multiple issues:

1. Fix ONE file
2. Run validation: `bun run lint && bun run type-check && bun run biome:check`
3. Commit ONLY that file with SPECIFIC message
4. Move to next file and repeat

**NEVER DO THIS:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Multiple files in one commit
git add file1.ts file2.ts file3.ts && git commit -m "fix: various issues"

# ❌ WRONG - Generic message
git add eslint.config.ts && git commit -m "fix: lint issues"
```

**ALWAYS DO THIS:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - One file, specific message
git add eslint.config.ts && git commit -m "fix(eslint): re-enable jsx-no-target-blank with allowReferrer"

# ✅ CORRECT - Next file, its own commit
git add lib/bookmarks.ts && git commit -m "fix(bookmarks): replace globalThis.isBookmarkRefreshLocked with distributed lock check"
```

**1. Get unresolved comments (GraphQL):**

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The query output WILL show unresolved comments! DO NOT assume there are none if the output appears empty at first glance. The jq filter produces JSON objects, not a message saying "no comments". If you see JSON output, THOSE ARE THE UNRESOLVED COMMENTS TO PROCESS!

```bash
# STEP 1: First check total thread count to detect pagination needs
echo "Checking total review thread count..."
TOTAL_THREADS=$(gh api graphql -f query='

    pullRequest(number: [PR_NUMBER]) {
      reviewThreads {
        totalCount
      }
    }
  }
}' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.totalCount')

echo "Total review threads: $TOTAL_THREADS"

# STEP 2: Handle pagination if needed (GitHub GraphQL limit is 100 per page)
echo "Checking for unresolved comments..."
if [ "$TOTAL_THREADS" -le 100 ]; then
  # Simple case: all threads fit in one request

**⚠️ CRITICAL INTERPRETATION RULES:**

1. **ALWAYS run the count check first** - This tells you definitively if there are unresolved comments
2. **"Tool ran without output" does NOT mean no comments** - The shell might not echo JSON output
3. **If UNRESOLVED_COUNT > 0, there ARE comments to process** - Do not assume otherwise
4. **Each JSON object in Step 2 output = ONE unresolved thread** - Process every single one

**2. For each comment:**

**PROCESSING WORKFLOW FOR EACH UNRESOLVED COMMENT**:
```bash
# For EACH comment in the output:
# 1. Extract these values:
THREAD_ID="PRRT_..."      # From "Thread ID:" line
FILE_PATH="path/to/file"  # From "Path:" line  
LINE_NUM="123"            # From "Line:" line
COMMENT_ID="2148802948"   # From "Comment ID:" line (numeric!)

# 2. Read the full comment body
gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.id == "'$THREAD_ID'") | .comments.nodes[0].body'

# 3. Analyze and decide (see Deep Thinking Protocol)

# 4. IF implementing:
- Read file at specified line
- Make changes
- Run: bun run lint && bun run type-check && bun run biome:check
- Commit ONLY this file with specific message

# 5. Reply to comment (use numeric COMMENT_ID):
gh api -X POST repos/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/pulls/[PR]/comments/$COMMENT_ID/replies \
  -f body="[Your response]"

# 6. Resolve thread (use THREAD_ID):
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "'$THREAD_ID'"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

**3. Reply to comment (REST API - see note):**

First get the numeric comment ID from GraphQL output:
```bash
# The GraphQL query returns both 'id' and 'databaseId'
# Use the 'databaseId' value for REST API calls
```

Then reply using the numeric databaseId:
```bash
# Implemented:
gh api -X POST repos/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/pulls/[PR]/comments/[NUMERIC_DATABASE_ID]/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in commit [HASH]. [What was done]"

# Rejected:
gh api -X POST repos/WilliamAGH/williamcallahan.com/pulls/[PR]/comments/[NUMERIC_DATABASE_ID]/replies \
  -f body="After careful analysis, I've decided not to implement this suggestion because [detailed reasoning]. The current implementation [explain why it's better]."
```

**Note**: GitHub's GraphQL API cannot reply to review comments. The mutation `addPullRequestReviewCommentReply` suggested by linters doesn't exist. GitHub deprecated `addPullRequestReviewComment` and promised `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` as replacement, but it was never implemented. REST API is the ONLY way to reply to PR review comments.

**4. Resolve thread (GraphQL):**

Use the thread ID (not comment ID) from the GraphQL output:
```bash
# The thread ID starts with "PRRT_" (e.g., "PRRT_kwDONglMk85SSn9V")
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "[THREAD_ID_STARTING_WITH_PRRT]"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

## 💡 REMEMBER

- **EVERY comment needs a reply AND thread resolution** - Even rejected suggestions
- Rejection is OK if suggestion doesn't improve code
- Comments don't auto-resolve - use thread ID to resolve
- Each file gets separate commit with descriptive message
- **Mark threads as resolved AFTER replying** - Whether implemented or rejected

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **JQ syntax errors**: The `!=` operator in jq must be written without backslash escaping
   - ❌ Wrong: `select(.databaseId \!= null)`
   - ✅ Correct: `select(.databaseId != null)`

2. **Comment ID confusion**: Always use numeric `databaseId` for REST replies, not GraphQL IDs
   - ❌ Wrong: Using ID like `PRRC_kwDONglMk86AFCFz`
   - ✅ Correct: Using numeric ID like `2148802931`

3. **Forgetting to validate**: ALWAYS run validation before committing, even for "simple" fixes

## 🤖 CRITICAL LLM INSTRUCTIONS

**MANDATORY EXECUTION PATTERN**:
```bash
1. RUN: UNRESOLVED_COUNT=$(gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '[...] | length')
2. READ: The numeric value of $UNRESOLVED_COUNT
3. DECISION: If UNRESOLVED_COUNT > 0, then unresolved comments EXIST
4. ACTION: Process EVERY comment from Step 2 output
```

**OUTPUT INTERPRETATION RULES**:

- `Tool ran without output` → IGNORE THIS MESSAGE, run count check
- Empty visual output → DOES NOT MEAN no comments, run count check  
- `$UNRESOLVED_COUNT = 0` → No unresolved comments (ONLY valid signal)
- `$UNRESOLVED_COUNT > 0` → Unresolved comments EXIST, must process ALL

**FORBIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS**:

- ❌ "No output means no comments" → WRONG
- ❌ "Already processed this comment" → WRONG, only process `isResolved == false`
- ❌ "Can skip count check" → WRONG, count is mandatory first step
- ✅ "Trust only numeric count value" → CORRECT

## 📚 WORKING EXAMPLES

**Get all unresolved comments with both IDs:**
```bash
# First check total thread count
TOTAL_THREADS=$(gh api graphql -f query='
{
  repository(owner: "WilliamAGH", name: "williamcallahan.com") {
    pullRequest(number: 109) {
      reviewThreads {
        totalCount
      }
    }
  }
}' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.totalCount')

# Then fetch with pagination if needed
if [ "$TOTAL_THREADS" -le 100 ]; then
  # Simple case: fetch all in one request
  gh api graphql -f query='
  {
    repository(owner: "WilliamAGH", name: "williamcallahan.com") {
      pullRequest(number: 109) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            path
            line
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes {
                id
                databaseId
                body
                author { login }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)'
else
  # Complex case: use pagination (see main workflow above)
  echo "PR has more than 100 threads - use the full pagination workflow from Step 2"
fi
```

**Get IDs for specific file:**
```bash
# For a specific file's comments
gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.path == "lib/utils/api-sanitization.ts" and .isResolved == false)'
```
