I found myself doing a lot of manual linting and copy-pasting stack traces... and was elated when I discovered my beloved Claude Code CLI tool had some cool scripting/command functionality that was just the ticket for some quasi-automation.

And while Claude Code has many tools and agentic behaviors of its own built in behind the scenes, commands are a great way (in my opinion) to dip your toes into agentic behavior for coding.

Below I show how I've been customizing [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart), Anthropic's command-line companion, to squeeze the most productivity out of its tool chain and multi-agent skills.

<BackgroundInfo title="Intro to Claude Code in Your CLI">
Stop context-switching between your editor and terminal. Claude Code's built-in **/analyze** plus custom slash commands like **/project:lint** bring static analysis, error tracing, and project-specific helpers directly into your CLI workflow.
</BackgroundInfo>

> **In practice** I combine Claude Code's CLI (see the [Quickstart](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)) with custom Zen MCP tools to automate repetitive checks before every commit. The slash-command system ([reference](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)) plus the SDK's `-p` print mode let me treat Claude like any other Unix utility. The four scripts below show how I wire Claude into my workflow for PR reviews, build triage, lint aggregation, and Jest debugging.

## 0. Getting Started

<CollapseDropdown summary="0.1 Install & launch" id="install-launch">
- **Install globally**:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```
- **Launch in any repository**:
  ```bash
  claude
  ```
- **Docs & download**: [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
</CollapseDropdown>

Here are some ways I'm currently using Claude Code:

## 1. Basic Out-of-the-Box Linting

Claude Code provides basic linting capabilities using environment defaults, and custom commands offer tailored behavior for your specific project setup.

## 1.1 Linting with a Custom Command

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.1 /lint at a glance" id="lint-at-a-glance">
- **Purpose**: Runs your linter(s) via a custom slash command—perfect for ESLint, Flake8, golangci-lint, etc.
- **Syntax**: `/lint [path] [--fix]`
- **Note**: Claude displays the scope as a suffix, e.g., `/lint (project)` or `/lint (user)` based on where you saved the command
- **Docs**: [Slash Commands – Custom Commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
</CollapseDropdown>

```bash
# Check staged files, fix if possible
a$ /lint --fix
✅ Fixed 3 ESLint errors, 1 TypeScript warning
```

<BackgroundInfo title="Built-in vs custom commands">
Claude Code offers basic linting using environment defaults (like `/analyze` for error diagnosis), and custom commands provide behavior tailored to your project setup.

**Automatic scope detection**: When you type a command like `/lint`, Claude displays it with the scope as a suffix in parentheses—e.g., `/lint (project)` for repo-scoped commands or `/lint (user)` for personal commands—based on where the command file is located.

**npm scripts are different**: An entry like  
```json
"lint:claude": "claude -p '…'"
```  
executes Claude once in print mode and then exits; it doesn't launch the interactive REPL. If you need to keep chatting, either run `claude -c` afterward to reopen the last session or start an interactive session first (`claude`) and invoke your slash commands there.
</BackgroundInfo>

## 2. Instant Error Diagnosis

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.1 /analyze" id="analyze-command"> 
- **Purpose**: Given a stack trace or failing test output, Claude pinpoints the source file, probable cause, and suggests a minimal fix.
- **Usage**: Pipe any stderr/stdout into the command.
- **Docs**: [Slash Commands – /analyze](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
</CollapseDropdown>

```bash
# Example: detect why tests fail
a$ npm test 2>&1 | claude -p "/analyze"
```

Claude responds with a ranked list of root-cause candidates, including linked code excerpts and one-line fix suggestions.

## 3. Crafting Custom Commands

<CollapseDropdown summary="3.1 The recipe – Markdown Commands" id="recipe">
1. **Create the directory** (once per repo):  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   ```
   
2. **Add a Markdown file** named after your command—**`prune-branches.md`**, **`lint.md`**, etc.  
   The file's contents become the prompt that Claude will run.

   ```markdown
   <!-- prune-branches.md example -->
   Delete all local branches that have already been merged into main.
   ```
3. **Reload Claude** inside the REPL with `/reload` (or simply restart the CLI).  

4. **Docs**: See [Slash Commands – Custom Commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) for namespacing (`/project:` vs `/user:`) and `$ARGUMENTS` usage.
</CollapseDropdown>



> You can store commands **globally** in `~/.claude/commands/` or keep them **project-scoped** in `.claude/commands/`. Claude automatically detects the scope and displays it as a suffix, e.g., `/commit (user)` or `/commit (project)`. See the [slash-command docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) for details on scoping.

<BackgroundInfo title="Home vs Project Scopes — Quick Reference">
• **Filename ➜ Command name**: the Markdown file's basename (minus `.md`) becomes your command name.

| Where you save the file | Example file | How to run it | How Claude displays it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal scope (works in every repo) | `~/.claude/commands/commit.md` | `/commit` | `/commit (user)` |
| Project scope (only in current repo) | `.claude/commands/commit.md` | `/commit` | `/commit (project)` |

**Tip**: If you create sub-directories, the folder path becomes part of the command—e.g. `.claude/commands/deploy/staging.md` ⇒ `/deploy/staging (project)`.
</BackgroundInfo>

<BackgroundInfo title="Alternative: Package.json Scripts">
You could also add Claude commands to your `package.json` (or equivalent) as scripts, but this approach has limitations:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:claude": "claude -p 'Run ESLint and fix all issues found'"
  }
}
```

**But the issues/drawbacks are currently:**

- **No interactive REPL** - runs once and exits, no "conversation"
- **No tool access** - can't use MCP servers, Edit tools, etc.
- **No multi-step workflows** - single prompt only
- **Awkward continuation** - must use `claude -c` to resume conversation

**Best practices if using scripts:**

- Write very detailed, comprehensive prompts hoping Claude gets it right in one shot
- Use `claude -c` afterward if you need to continue the conversation
- Consider this mainly for simple, one-shot tasks rather than complex workflows

**Recommendation:** Stick with slash commands for the rich, interactive experience your complex recipes require.

## 4. Template Command Recipes Ideas

Here are some "commands" I'm currently using and finding very helpful that I personally wrote, I hope you find them helpful!

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.1 /doublecheck – AI Pull-Request Review" id="user-doublecheck">
Invoke your personal **doublecheck** command to analyze the current diff against `main` for bugs, outdated APIs, and more.

```bash
/doublecheck
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/doublecheck.md -->
You are a code reviewer.

STEP 1: Output the full git diff vs main branch.

STEP 2: Analyze and identify:

1) Potential bugs or logic errors
2) Usage of deprecated or outdated API methods
3) Security vulnerabilities
4) Performance issues

Use web search and available MCP servers to verify API usage against current documentation.

STEP 3: For each issue found, use the Edit or MultiEdit tools to implement the fix directly in the codebase.

STEP 4: After all fixes are applied, run git diff again to show the changes made.

Output a summary of all fixes implemented.
```
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.2 /build – Build Log Triage" id="user-build">
Run your **build** helper to execute `bun run build`, surface errors, and iterate until the build is clean.

```bash
/build
```

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/build.md -->
Run the build command and analyze any errors or warnings.

First, execute: bun run build

STEP 1: Output the full build log for reference.
STEP 2: Analyze the build output using @mcp__zen__thinkdeep with model="pro".
STEP 3: If there are errors: explain, read, edit, document.
STEP 4: If build succeeds but warnings exist, fix those too.
STEP 5: Re-run the build to verify.
```
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.3 /full-lint – Deep Lint Aggregation" id="user-full-lint">
Run every linter plus type-checker, then let Claude fix issues in priority order.
