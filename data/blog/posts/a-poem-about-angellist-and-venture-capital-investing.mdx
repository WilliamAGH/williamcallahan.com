<div className="mb-6">
  For on [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/investors/syndicates)'s stage, where opportunities gleam, Lurk the perils
  of investing, like a treacherous stream.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  Oh, venture capital investing, a gamble profound, Where fortunes rise high or come crashing down. On AngelList's
  platform, where startups abound, The risks are aplenty, like whispers in the sound.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  First comes the notion of hidden uncertainty, As startups paint pictures of future prosperity. Their visions may
  sparkle with promise so grand, But can it truly thrive in an unpredictable land?
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  The allure of returns may cloud one's discerning sight, As angel investors chase dreams day and night. Yet not every
  startup will reach its destined height, And losses can darken even the brightest light.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  Fraudulent ventures too can haunt this digital shore, Camouflaged amidst promises and lore. Investors must beware of
  deceitful schemes, For trust is fragile and shattered by extremes.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  Moreover, liquidity may be hard to find, With investments locked up in a complex bind. Exit strategies may elude like
  fleeting birds in flight, Leaving investors stranded under the dimming light.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  And let us not forget the ever-changing tide, Where markets shift swiftly like an ocean so wide. A startup's fate
  intertwined with economic sway, Can leave investors marooned along the bay.
</div>

<div className="mb-6">
  So heed this cautionary tale when investing your dime, On AngelList's platform or any venture sublime. For while
  opportunities beckon with allure so grand, Risks loom large in this uncertain land.
</div>

<div className="mb-12">
  In the realm of capital ventures, where dreams take flight, There lies a platform, promising futures so bright.
  AngelList, they call it, where dreams meet with cash, Where investors seek startups, hoping for a splash.
</div>

  have) investing in. So we're building a database of > 50,000 startups that are venture-funded along with the people
