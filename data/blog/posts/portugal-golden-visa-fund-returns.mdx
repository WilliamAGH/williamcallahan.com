I found return data hard to come by for private funds in Portugal's Golden Visa investment program, so I began aggregating it here. If you're an investor in a private fund in Portugal, feel free to share your NAV (net asset value, or price per share) updates and I can calculate performance updates for you here. [Just send me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamacallahan/) and I can add it here and let you know once calculated.
