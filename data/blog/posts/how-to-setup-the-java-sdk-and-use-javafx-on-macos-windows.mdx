<BackgroundInfo title="Overview: Key Components & Their Roles">
This guide covers setting up a JavaFX development environment. Here's a quick look at the essential parts and why they matter:

- **Environment Variables (`JAVA_HOME`, `PATH`)**: Tells your system where to find the Java Development Kit (JDK) for command-line tools.
- **Build Tool (Maven/Gradle)**: Manages project dependencies (like JavaFX libraries) and automates the build process.
- **FXML**: XML-based files for defining the structure and layout of your user interface, separating design from logic.
- **SceneBuilder**: A visual tool for designing and editing FXML files without writing XML code directly.

</BackgroundInfo>

## 1: Set $JAVA_HOME (_environment variable_)

Set up `JAVA_HOME` globally on macOS and Windows to prepare your system for Java applications.

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.1: Download Java SDK">
  - **[Download Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)**:
    - **For macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3)**: Download the macOS ARM64 DMG Installer
    - **For macOS Intel**: Download the macOS x64 DMG Installer
    - **For Windows**: Download the Windows x64 Installer
  <BackgroundInfo title="Note on JDK version">
  I recommend always using the current long-term stable branch (LTS), which is 21 as of this writing.
  </BackgroundInfo>
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.2: Install Java">
  - **macOS**: Open the downloaded .dmg file and follow the installer instructions. The default installation location will be:
    `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home`
  - **Windows**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. The default location is typically:
    `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="1.3: Set JAVA_HOME environment variable">
  - **macOS**: Add JAVA_HOME to your `.zshrc` file and apply it immediately:
    ```bash
    `echo 'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`
    ```
  - **Windows**: Open **System Properties** (Win + Pause/Break), go to **Advanced system settings**, and under `Environment Variables`, add:
    - **Variable name**: `JAVA_HOME`
    - **Variable value**: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21` _(update version if different)_
    - Then edit the `Path` variable and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
</CollapseDropdown>
<BackgroundInfo title="Do you still need JAVA_HOME?">
While modern IDEs often manage their own JDK settings, setting `JAVA_HOME` globally is still crucial for command-line tools like Maven and Gradle.
</BackgroundInfo>

## Part 2: Setting up JavaFX in IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code

<BackgroundInfo title="What is JavaFX?">
JavaFX is a toolkit/library for developing JavaFX graphical (GUI) applications. It is no longer included with the JDK, though. While you can still download it from [Gluon JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), it's best practice to let your build tool (Maven/Gradle) manage it as a project dependency. **Avoid installing JavaFX system-wide.**
</BackgroundInfo>

**Integrated Setup in IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code**: Both IDEs offer seamless onboarding for JavaFX projects. Select JavaFX from the project templates, and the IDE will configure the necessary settings.

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.1: Setup for Microsoft VS Code">
  <BackgroundInfo title="What is the Java extension pack?">
  The Extension Pack for Java is a great way to get Java setup in one click in VS Code with things like IntelliSense, debugging, and more.
  </BackgroundInfo>
  **[Download Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: Then install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="2.2: Setup for IntelliJ IDEA">
  **[Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)**
  <BackgroundInfo title="IntelliJ IDEA - batteries included">
  After you download and install an IntelliJ IDE from JetBrains), you're all set! IDEA comes with what you need to get started with Java & JavaFX.
  </BackgroundInfo>
</CollapseDropdown>

<BackgroundInfo title="Version Compatibility is Key">
Based on my experience, using the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) versions consistently across tools minimizes compatibility issues. I recommend sticking to **JDK 21**, **JavaFX 21**, and **Scene Builder 23** (or the latest corresponding LTS versions) for a smoother setup. Using other versions on my ARM64-based Mac resulted in errors, so watch out for that.
</BackgroundInfo>

## Part 3: Integrating Scene Builder

Scene Builder is a visual layout tool for designing JavaFX UIs (.fxml files). First, download it, then tell your IDE where to find it.

<CollapseDropdown summary="3.1: Download and Install Scene Builder">
  Visit the [Gluon Scene Builder website](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) to download the latest version (LTS recommended, currently 23). Install it using the downloaded installer.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="3.2: Configure Path in IntelliJ IDEA">
  - Go to **Settings/Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > JavaFX**.
  - Click the folder icon next to "Path to SceneBuilder" and navigate to the installed Scene Builder application.
      - _macOS typical path_: `/Applications/SceneBuilder.app` > Contents > MacOS > SceneBuilder
      - _Windows typical path_: `C:\Program Files\SceneBuilder\SceneBuilder.exe` (or similar)

## Part 4: Creating a JavaFX Project

Now that the JDK and Scene Builder are set up, here's how to create a new JavaFX project.

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.1: Create New Project in IntelliJ IDEA">
  - Go to **File > New > Project**.
  - Select **JavaFX** from the list on the left.
  - Choose your project SDK (should be the Java 21 JDK you installed).
  - Select **Maven** or **Gradle** as the build system.
  - Fill in your project details (Name, Location, GroupId, ArtifactId).
  - Click **Create**.

  />
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="4.2: Create New Project in VS Code">
  - Open the Command Palette (**Cmd+Shift+P** on macOS, **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows).
  - Type `Java: Create Java Project` and press Enter
  - Select **JavaFX** from the list
  - It'll ask for your desired repository version number for this new project, you can just hit enter to proceed with the default (_'version' 1.0-SNAPSHOT_)
  - When prompted to confirm (Y/N), make sure you hit N to be able to change the JavaFX version to 21 (_no other details should need changed, just hit enter to proceed with the default each time_)
  - Choose a folder location for your new project

    caption="Use the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) -> 'Java: Create Java Project' -> 'JavaFX' and follow the prompts"
  />
  - Once created, VS Code will open the new project. You can test run it:
    - Open the `App.java` file (usually under `src/main/java/com/example/`).
    - Click the "Run" button that appears above the `main` method or press **F5**.

  />
</CollapseDropdown>

<BackgroundInfo title="What are the components of a JavaFX application?">
  JavaFX separates layout (FXML) from logic (Java Controllers). Scene Builder edits the FXML files visually. The `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` file manages dependencies like the JavaFX libraries. Key components include:
  - **FXML Files (e.g., `primary.fxml`, `secondary.fxml`)**: XML files describing the GUI layout.
  - **Java Controllers**: Classes linked to FXML for handling logic and interaction.
  - **Scene Builder**: A visual tool for editing FXML files.
  - **Java Code vs FXML**: You can build UIs programmatically (Java) or declaratively (FXML). FXML promotes separation of concerns.
</BackgroundInfo>

## 5: Opening FXML Files in Scene Builder

Once your project is open and you have configured the Scene Builder path (as shown in Part 3), you can easily edit your UI layout files directly from your IDE.

    caption="Default IntelliJ JavaFX project structure. Note the location of the main application class (1) and the FXML view file (2)."
    size="small"
  />
  With your project open in IntelliJ IDEA and the Scene Builder path configured (as shown in Part 3.2), you can easily edit your UI layout files:
  - Navigate to your FXML file (e.g., `src/main/resources/com/example/hello-view.fxml`) in the IntelliJ Project tool window.
  - Right-click on the `.fxml` file.
  - Select **Open In SceneBuilder** from the context menu.

</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="5.2: VS Code">
  Once your project is open in VS Code and you have configured the Scene Builder path (as shown in Part 3.3), you can easily edit your UI layout files:
  - Navigate to your FXML file (e.g., `src/main/resources/com/example/primary.fxml`) in the VS Code Explorer.
  - Right-click on the `.fxml` file.
  - Select **Open in Scene Builder** from the context menu.

  />
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="5.3: Editing with Scene Builder">
  Whether you open the `.fxml` file from IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code, Scene Builder will launch as a separate application.
  It loads your FXML file, allowing you to visually inspect the component hierarchy, drag and drop new UI elements from the library, and modify properties in the inspector pane.
  Any changes saved in Scene Builder are directly written back to the `.fxml` file in your project.

## 6: Diagnosing Errors

<CollapseDropdown summary="6.1: Common Issues & Fixes">
  - **`java: command not found` (or similar)**:
      - **Likely Cause**: Incorrect `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH` environment variables.
      - **Fix**: Review the environment variable setup steps (Part 1). Ensure paths point to your JDK 21 `bin` directory. **Important**: Restart your terminal *and* IDE after making changes.

  - **Multiple JDK Conflicts**:
      - **Issue**: Wrong JDK used if `JAVA_HOME` or IDE settings point to an older version.
      - **Check**: List installed JDKs (`/usr/libexec/java_home -V` on macOS; check `C:\Program Files\Java` on Windows).
      - **Fix**: Explicitly set `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK 21 path. Configure the correct JDK in your IDE's project settings. Consider uninstalling unused JDKs.
  <BackgroundInfo title="Quick verification checks">
  After setup (and restarting your terminal/IDE), run these commands to confirm:
  ```bash
# Verify JAVA_HOME (use correct command for your OS)
echo $JAVA_HOME   # macOS/Linux
echo %JAVA_HOME%  # Windows

# Verify java executable path (use correct command for your OS)
which java       # macOS/Linux
where java       # Windows

# Verify java version
java -version    # Should show JDK 21
  ```
  If commands fail or show the wrong version, re-check environment variable settings.
