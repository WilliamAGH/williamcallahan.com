excerpt: "A modern guide to setting up Java development with JavaFX on macOS and Windows using IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code. While setting `JAVA_HOME` is still useful for some tools like Maven and Gradle, many modern Java environments have reduced reliance on it. This guide covers both legacy and current best practices, including integration with Scene Builder and modern IDEs."

<BackgroundInfo title="Overview: Key Components & Their Roles">
This guide covers setting up a JavaFX development environment. Here's a quick look at the essential parts and why they matter:

- **Environment Variables (`JAVA_HOME`, `PATH`)**: Tells your system where to find the Java Development Kit (JDK) for command-line tools.
- **Build Tool (Maven/Gradle)**: Manages project dependencies (like JavaFX libraries) and automates the build process.
- **FXML**: XML-based files for defining the structure and layout of your user interface, separating design from logic.
- **SceneBuilder**: A visual tool for designing and editing FXML files without writing XML code directly.

</BackgroundInfo>

## 1: Set $JAVA_HOME (_environment variable_)

Set up `JAVA_HOME` globally on macOS and Windows to prepare your system for Java applications.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 1.1: Download Java SDK">
  - **[Download Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)**:
    - **For macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3)**: Download the macOS ARM64 DMG Installer
    - **For macOS Intel**: Download the macOS x64 DMG Installer
    - **For Windows**: Download the Windows x64 Installer
  <BackgroundInfo title="Note on JDK version">
  I recommend always using the current long-term stable branch (LTS), which is 21 as of this writing. I encountered errors between JavaFX and Java's JDK with other versions.
  </BackgroundInfo>
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 1.2: Install Java">
  - **macOS**: Open the downloaded .dmg file and follow the installer instructions. The default installation location will be:
    `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-21.jdk/Contents/Home`
  - **Windows**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. The default location is typically:
    `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 1.3: Set JAVA_HOME environment variable">
  - **macOS**: Add JAVA_HOME to your `.zshrc` file and apply it immediately:
    ```bash
    `echo 'export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`
    ```
  - **Windows**: Open **System Properties** (Win + Pause/Break), go to **Advanced system settings**, and under `Environment Variables`, add:
    - **Variable name**: `JAVA_HOME`
    - **Variable value**: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21` _(update version if different)_
    - Then edit the `Path` variable and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
</CollapseDropdown>
<BackgroundInfo title="Do you still need JAVA_HOME?">
While modern IDEs often manage their own JDK settings, setting `JAVA_HOME` globally is still crucial for command-line tools like Maven and Gradle. If not set, you might encounter errors like `The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly`. This step ensures broader compatibility.

## Part 2: Project-Level Settings for JavaFX

<BackgroundInfo title="What is JavaFX?">
JavaFX is a toolkit/library for developing JavaFX graphical (GUI) applications. It is no longer included with the JDK, though. While you can still download it from [Gluon JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), we'll let the IDE do that for us via the Maven or Gradle build tools.
</BackgroundInfo>

**Integrated Setup in IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code**: Both IDEs offer seamless onboarding for JavaFX projects. Select JavaFX from the project templates, and the IDE will configure the necessary settings.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 2.1: Setup for Microsoft VSCode">
  <BackgroundInfo title="What is the Java extension pack?">
  The Extension Pack for Java is a great way to get Java setup in one click in VSCode with things like IntelliSense, debugging, and more.
  </BackgroundInfo>
  **[Download Microsoft VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**: Then install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 2.2: Setup for IntelliJ IDEA">
  **[Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)**
  <BackgroundInfo title="IntelliJ IDEA - batteries included">
  After you download and install an IntelliJ IDE from JetBrains), you're all set! IDEA comes with what you need to get started with Java & JavaFX.

## Part 3: Integrating Scene Builder

Scene Builder is a visual layout tool for designing JavaFX UIs (.fxml files). First, download it, then tell your IDE where to find it.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 3.1: Download and Install Scene Builder">
  Visit the [Gluon Scene Builder website](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) to download the latest version (LTS recommended, currently 23). Install it using the downloaded installer.
</CollapseDropdown>

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 3.2: Configure Path in IntelliJ IDEA">
  - Go to **Settings/Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > JavaFX**.
  - Click the folder icon next to "Path to SceneBuilder" and navigate to the installed Scene Builder application.
      - _macOS typical path_: `/Applications/SceneBuilder.app` > Contents > MacOS > SceneBuilder
      - _Windows typical path_: `C:\Program Files\SceneBuilder\SceneBuilder.exe` (or similar)

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 3.3: Configure Path in VS Code">
  *   Install the [SceneBuilder extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=bilalekrem.scenebuilderextension).
  *   Open the Command Palette (**Cmd+Shift+P** on macOS, **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows).
  *   Type `SceneBuilder: Set path` and select it.
  *   Browse to and select your installed Scene Builder executable.

  />
  *   Once configured, you can right-click an `.fxml` file in the VS Code explorer and choose "Open in Scene Builder".
  <BackgroundInfo title="Does Scene Builder require environment variables?">
  Scene Builder is self-contained and doesn't need `JAVA_HOME`. It edits `.fxml` files directly. You only need to configure the path within your IDE to enable direct opening of FXML files.

## Part 4: Creating a JavaFX Project

Now that the JDK and Scene Builder are set up, here's how to create a new JavaFX project.

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 4.1: Create New Project in IntelliJ IDEA">
  - Go to **File > New > Project**.
  - Select **JavaFX** from the list on the left.
  - Choose your project SDK (should be the Java 21 JDK you installed).
  - Select **Maven** or **Gradle** as the build system.
  - Fill in your project details (Name, Location, GroupId, ArtifactId).
  - Click **Create**.

</CollapseDropdown>

<BackgroundInfo title="What are the components of a JavaFX application?">
  JavaFX separates layout (FXML) from logic (Java Controllers). Scene Builder edits the FXML files visually. The `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` file manages dependencies like the JavaFX libraries. Key components include:
  - **FXML Files (e.g., `primary.fxml`, `secondary.fxml`)**: XML files describing the GUI layout.
  - **Java Controllers**: Classes linked to FXML for handling logic and interaction.
  - **Scene Builder**: A visual tool for editing FXML files.
  - **Java Code vs FXML**: You can build UIs programmatically (Java) or declaratively (FXML). FXML promotes separation of concerns.
</BackgroundInfo>

## Diagnosing Errors

<CollapseDropdown summary="Step 5.1: Common Issues & Fixes">
  - **`java: command not found` (or similar)**:
      - **Likely Cause**: Incorrect `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH` environment variables.
      - **Fix**: Review the environment variable setup steps (Part 1). Ensure paths point to your JDK 21 `bin` directory. **Important**: Restart your terminal *and* IDE after making changes.

  - **Multiple JDK Conflicts**:
      - **Issue**: Wrong JDK used if `JAVA_HOME` or IDE settings point to an older version.
      - **Check**: List installed JDKs (`/usr/libexec/java_home -V` on macOS; check `C:\Program Files\Java` on Windows).
      - **Fix**: Explicitly set `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK 21 path. Configure the correct JDK in your IDE's project settings. Consider uninstalling unused JDKs.
  <BackgroundInfo title="Quick verification checks">
  After setup (and restarting your terminal/IDE), run these commands to confirm:
  ```bash
# Verify JAVA_HOME (use correct command for your OS)
echo $JAVA_HOME   # macOS/Linux
echo %JAVA_HOME%  # Windows

# Verify java executable path (use correct command for your OS)
which java       # macOS/Linux
where java       # Windows

# Verify java version
java -version    # Should show JDK 21
  ```
  If commands fail or show the wrong version, re-check environment variable settings.
