<BackgroundInfo title="Update (April 28, 2025): Current Techstars Investment Terms">
Techstars' current deal is **$220,000** per company<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>:
- **$200,000** via an uncapped [MFN SAFE](https://capbase.com/most-favored-nation-mfn-clause-in-startup-investing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/)
- **$20,000** via a Post-Money Convertible Equity Agreement (CEA)

Techstars takes **5%** common stock (CEA) plus the SAFE conversion at the next priced round. See the official announcement for full details.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>

</BackgroundInfo>

Techstars is a big name in the accelerator world, known for backing thousands of companies since 2006. Having watched them from a distance since their documentary series on Bloomberg circa ~2011 <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>, I'd argue they're the second most important accelerator in the world still, after [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com/).

I went through Techstars NYC myself in Winter 2023/Spring 2024 with [aVenture.vc](https://aventure.vc), so I've seen the process up close. Here's a breakdown of how the Techstars investment has evolved, based on various sources over the years.

Both for my work at aVenture regarding [Techstars](https://aventure.vc/investors/firms/techstars-boulder-co-us) along with analyzing my [own investment from Techstars](https://aventure.vc/companies/aventure-venture-capital-san-francisco-ca-usa), I had to search for this data a few times and found it hard to come by, so I thought I'd share it here.
