Keeping track of deprecated files is a hassle. For me, it's lots of deja vu: "wait, didn't I do this three months ago?" ðŸ¤”

That's why I built [**Flag Deprecated Files**, a VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WilliamCallahan.flag-deprecated-files) that visually highlights files containing `@deprecated` tags directly in your file explorer.

## Why I Built This

Working in large repositories, I often flag files as deprecated with JSDoc/JavaDoc/Docstring tags when we're planning to phase them out. The problem? There was no easy way to *see* which files were deprecated without opening each one. In my case, these are repo's with a thousand + files, so it was a real pain.

I decided to build a lightweight extension that simply works. Since I needed it myself, I figured others might find it useful too!

## How It Works

The extension is refreshingly straightforward:

1. It scans your workspace for files with `@deprecated` tags in the first few lines (12 by default for speed)
2. Files with the tag get a visual deprecated indicator (âŠ˜) in the file explorer
3. Folders show a count of how many deprecated files they contain
4. Everything updates in real-time as you edit files


The best part? It's performant by defaultâ€”it only scans the first 12 lines of each file (configurable) and uses batched processing to avoid slowing down your IDE.

## Light & Performant

While building this, I focused on making it lightweight:

```typescript
async checkSingleFile(uri: vscode.Uri): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Quick check first 1KB for @deprecated
    const bytes = await vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(uri);
    const quickCheck = new TextDecoder().decode(bytes.slice(0, 1024));
    if (!quickCheck.includes('@deprecated')) {
      return false;
    }

    const document = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uri);
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(document.lineCount, this.config.maxLinesToScan); i++) {
      if (document.lineAt(i).text.includes('@deprecated')) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error processing file ${uri.fsPath}:`, error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

This two-phase approachâ€”first checking a 1KB chunk before doing a more thorough scanâ€”means it barely impacts your editor's performance, even in large projects.

## Customization Options

You can customize the extension through your `.vscode/settings.json` (the settings below are in it by default without requiring these to be specified, but using the command replaces the default settings):

```json
{
  "flagDeprecatedFiles.excludedDirectories": ["node_modules", "dist", "build"],
  "flagDeprecatedFiles.decorations.badge": "âŠ˜",
  "flagDeprecatedFiles.decorations.color": "amber",
  "flagDeprecatedFiles.maxLinesToScan": 12
}
```

Change the badge icon, choose your own color scheme, or adjust exactly which directories get scanned.

## How to Use / Get Started

The extension is available now on:
- [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WilliamCallahan.flag-deprecated-files) (for VSCode, Cursor)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/williamcallahan/flag-deprecated-files) (for VSCodium, Windsurf IDE, Trae, and other forks)

The [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/WilliamAGH/vscode-flag-deprecated-files-extension).

## What's Next?

I'd love to hear any suggestions for improvements! You can [request features or report bugs here](https://github.com/williamagh/vscode-flag-deprecated-files-extension/issues).

If you work with large codebases and deprecated files, I hope this little extension makes your IDE experience just a bit better!
